I checked in easily in the afternoon and was given a good tour of the house which is filled with beautiful furniture and decorations from all over the world. The most important part of a hostel, in my opinion, is the shared spaces, and Traveler's does a great job of keeping a clean, comfy, and always open living and kitchen space. I spent most of my time in those spaces! The staff is great and super helpful!"
4583862,36038273,2015-06-24,2382594,Katie,"I truely cant say enough positive things about Travellers House. The place is a haven. The neighborhood is wonderful, leafy and quiet but so close to amazing Mississippi Street which is full of great food trucks, shops and restaurants. The hosts are super friendly and accomodating and the place just has a really chilled, homely vibe and is SO clean. Its by far the nicest 'hostel' I've ever stayed in, I instantly felt at home here as did everyone else I spoke to and Tate, Ryan and Grant were just wonderful. "
4583862,38755681,2015-07-18,22235367,Rosemary,"Had such a lovely experience at this hostel. Welcoming people, rooms were comfortable (lots of outlets, private lights and fans if needed), bathrooms clean, kitchen well equipped. Met some great people. Excellent location - some of the coolest areas are 10 minutes walk away. Thanks for having me!"
4583862,40350294,2015-07-30,34369117,Elizabeth,Helpful and detailed initial tour of the premises. Friendly and accommodating. Very clean! Wonderfully environmentally conscious. Quite a selection of well-maintained bikes for rent.
4583862,41514656,2015-08-07,29969180,Brent,Great place great staff great location very clean all around one of the best hostels ive stayed at.
4583862,42912871,2015-08-16,34485841,Adam,"This was the best hostel experience I've ever had. Everyone was super welcoming and informative. If you want to augment your stay in Portland by being surrounded by awesome people, stay here."
4583862,49661703,2015-10-05,23253788,Lauren,"Wonderful location! Clean! Friendly staff!
I recommend this hostel, it's in a great location (right around the corner from several coffee places, a grocery store, bars, ahopping, and easy access to public transit. The atmosphere is very chill and comfortable. All employees were knowledgeable and willing to share about all the local spots. "
4583862,50805383,2015-10-14,5479393,Colleen,"I had a great stay at the Traveler's House! The bed was very comfortable, and the room had lockers to store valuables. This was a very special hostel inside a house, very unique vibe. The kitchen was incredible! The house had plenty of lounging area and even space to do yoga. The place was very clean, from the rooms to the bathrooms. I would recommend staying here. "
4583862,51773258,2015-10-24,42395583,Jordan,This was my first hostel experience and it was a great one. The house is beautiful and the people I met were very nice. I heard a lot of funny stories and there was a good bond between the people there. I had a good time in Portland because of the Traveler's House. 
4583862,68747440,2016-04-06,23112725,Courtney,"Travelers house was so wonderful! I stayed in the 4 person room. Within walking distance of so many great places, one of my favorite neighborhoods.  Everyone was very respectful of quiet times and met so many wonderfully sweet people! I will most definitely be booking here again for my next stay in Portland."
11987076,67116321,2016-03-26,64366756,Mandy,Carrie was incredibly flexible and helpful in suggesting a place to have breakfast the next day! Her place is very clean and comfortable as well. 
11987076,67362535,2016-03-28,58342578,Valerie,"Carrie was incredibly welcoming! She was there when we arrived and we enjoyed chatting with her for a fair bit. Her home is cozy, colorful, and super clean. She had warned us that her outdoor pet pig would get ""oinky"" in the morning but the bed we stayed in was so comfortable (and wonderful for my bad back!), we slept right through it and didn't hear a thing.

We would happily stay with Carrie again!"
11987076,68795410,2016-04-06,62711741,Alex,A really good experience. Carrie is super nice and helpful. She has an awesome pig in the back that's fun to hangout with. And she stays busy so there is good privacy
11987076,70513135,2016-04-18,65657454,Shane,My husband and I found Carrie's house to be extremely comfortable and cozy! We were able to find her house easily and had the pleasure of meeting Carrie one of the mornings we were there. Otherwise we pretty much had the place to ourselves (when not out and about taking in the sites of Portland!) Carrie's potbelly pig was fun to meet and I barely heard him oinking :) There are plenty of restaurants nearby and also within walking distance of the MAX and bus lines. Thanks Carrie!
11987076,70790207,2016-04-20,67390417,Joe,"Carrie was very accommodating. She provided a very warm environment for my stay. If ever back in town, I would try to airbnb.com with her again."
11987076,71222468,2016-04-24,15068980,Ben,"Carrie's place was cozy and homey, very clean, well decorated with modern furniture, and very comfortable.

Carrie was nice and considerate and we interacted a bit only as we were out and about mostly.  She stayed in her room when at home allowing us to use the living room.

The pig she mentioned is not even loud.  Barely an oink.

I enjoyed my stay here.  I would definitely  rent again if I rolled up to Portland again. 
"
11987076,74283990,2016-05-14,27479665,Sonia,"I was only able to stay for one night due to work related issues, but my friends stayed their for 2 nights and had positive things to say. Carrie's house was exactly as described, very clean and comfortable. 15min away from downtown Portland made it easy to get to. "
11987076,76125202,2016-05-25,47031985,Iris,"Wir erhielten von Carrie ein Blatt mit Tips&Tricks f√ºr die Wohnung und Portland.
Wir haben uns bei ihr sofort zuhause gef√ºhlt. Ihre Wohnung ist sehr sch√∂n eingerichtet, gem√ºtlich und gleichzeitig gro√ genug.
In der K√ºche durften wir alle Gegenst√§nde benutzen und konnten so selbst Essen zubereiten. Carrie ist super nett, hat uns immer geholfen und alle Fragen geduldig beantwortet und hat uns gleichzeitig viel Raum gelassen.

Das Schwein oinkt selten und wenn sehr leise, so dass es nicht st√∂rend war :-)

Mit dem Bus (Tagesticket 5$) ist man schnell in der Stadt. Auch Lebensmittelgesch√§fte sind zufu√ und mit dem Bus gut zu erreichen.

Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr h√ºbsch und alle Nachbarn freundlich."
11987076,77971983,2016-06-04,1103333,Elizabeth,"Great experience overall. Although we only met briefly, Carrie was a very accessible and friendly host. The room was as expected from the photos, and a perfectly cozy place to stay. We loved having access to the bathroom (a shower with great water pressure is really underrated) and kitchen. Plus the sweet pig to say hello to from the window! Friendly neighborhood, great host, comfortable space - can't go wrong with this one!"
11987076,78300861,2016-06-06,27550722,Caroline,"Carrie was easy to get ahold of and was flexible with our check in time. She wasn't home when we arrived but the house was clean, adorable, and very welcoming. It felt like Carrie went out of her way to make our stay comfortable while also respecting our privacy. "
11987076,78612048,2016-06-07,20901634,Kenny,"I loved the place. It's nice and quiet, comfy bed. I didn't hear the pig once. Was hoping to hear a few oinks though. Carrie wasn't home while I was but I ran into one night. Super nice. 10 and 14 bus  goes right to trendy SE and downtown Portland. Close to airport also. Will consider this for my next time in Portland. =)"
11987076,79746755,2016-06-14,74301530,Jurell,"Carrie's house is lovely! We had a comfortable stay there while we were getting settled in to our new home in Portland, and she was a very welcoming host. Her pig Remington is a fun character, and we could hardly hear him from the room we were staying in. Would definitely recommend to other travelers!"
11987076,81404368,2016-06-22,57941530,ALi,"Carrie was a great host.  Although we never met her, she responded to all our questions and made us feel very welcomed in her home.  Carrie has a beautiful little home in an awesome area!  Would definitely recommend to friends!"
11987076,81910747,2016-06-25,25805353,Cyrus R.,"Our stay with Carrie was short and sweet. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to meet her in person due to our late arrival and early departure, but she was communicative and made things very easy for us. We would stay here again. "
8371484,52298671,2015-10-27,5609245,Kris,"Private but awesome setting in the middle of arguably the best spot in Downtown. Most importantly, the bed was comfortable. "
8371484,52540883,2015-10-30,42313812,Ben,"Wonderful place to stay, close to a lot of nice restaurants and coffee bars. clean and spacious, super comfy bed. Definitely will try to stay here again when we come back to portland"
8371484,53384290,2015-11-08,4984170,Robert,"My new favorite AirBnB in Portland! It's a beautiful space in an amazing location. I was worried it might be noisy in that neighborhood, being that the first night of my stay was First Thursday. Parking was a challenge that night but other than that it was a wonderful evening. The apartment was quiet very comfortable each and every night.

I did see a notice in the elevator of a building meeting to discuss whether to allow short term rentals like AirBnB. I went out of my way to be polite to other tenants as I'd love to come back to this space!"
8371484,54258980,2015-11-17,305514,Drew,"The loft was perfectly located. We could walk to all sorts of breweries, restaurants and great shops. Zac had prepared the house for us with fresh beverages, towels & sheets. We couldn't have had a better experience for our Portland trip."
8371484,54809946,2015-11-23,1435011,Tarso,"Really nice apartment, very responsive host, great location. All went really well, highly recommended. "
8371484,55672422,2015-12-04,3690636,Gena,"This loft is perfection! The weather wasn't so great during our visit, but staying at such a lovely place completely made up for spending more time indoors! The bed is so comfortable and everything looks as beautiful as the photos. Also no one is currently living in the loft so it is free of most personal items (except interesting architecture books!). Location is perfect--super close to all the shops and restaurants we wanted to visit. Zac and Fumi were super communicative and flexible even when we arrived a few hours later than initially planned. My only suggestion if you stay here is to bring slippers :)"
8371484,55936972,2015-12-07,47280993,Kristy,"Zac and Fumi are very responsive hosts who were accommodating and approachable. They replied to our inquiries and texts immediately. The instructions for the unit were very thorough. The loft is in a wonderful location close to the heart of the Pearl. It's decor is very sophisticated and unique. Street parking was easy in the evening which saved us parking fees in a garage. The unit was really quiet and the neighbors were friendly. It is a dark space and the lighting is a little tricky, but all in all, we had a wonderful time and would stay there again. "
8371484,56614918,2015-12-15,177032,Jennifer,"Zac & Fumi are amazing hosts! They are super fast to respond and Zac was there to greet us at our arrival to show us around. They were flexible with our check-in/out times and provided such a great space with all of the amenities you could need for a short or long stay. One thing to note is that in winter, the apartment is quite 'cozy' at night and lighting is not super bright. This was no problem for us, but if you're used to bright overhead lights, this might be an adjustment for you. 

The bed and sofa were SUPER comfortable - perfect for rainy Portland afternoons and nights, which is what we experienced the whole time we were in town :) The comfort of the apartment and proximity to * everything * totally made up for the dismal weather though. We would love to return here and actually call this space home. Thanks again! "
8371484,57043441,2015-12-21,35864262,Erica,"This is a lovely Airbnb.

Smack bang in the middle of the Pearl... 

Everything you need is in this flat - it's a really good place to stay."
8371484,59306227,2016-01-09,23439164,Graham,Zac was a great host; nothing was too difficult to get.  A great welcome for a new visitor
8371484,59765319,2016-01-15,18939321,Kaitlin,"A great location in the heart of the Pearl District with good food, art galleries and shopping all around. The loft is decorated in a casual and comfortable style that feels part of the creative community."
8371484,60694967,2016-01-26,30109703,Tim,"Definitely rent this place if you want the ""true"" Portland experience. It basically comes with everything except a beard. Within literal steps of world-class coffee and beer, the loft itself will inspire you to FaceTime your friends back home just so they see what you look like in this particular loft. Also, Zac and Fumi are extremely text-able and accessible, and the building is totally clean and upscale without being pretentious. I rate the whole experience 1000 points out of a 1000. "
8371484,60956370,2016-01-30,4713123,Tim,"We had a great time in Portland! This is an amazing place to pray. Right in the heart of the trendy Pearl district- right across the street from an amazing tapas restaurant, coffee shops and world class breweries within walking distant. 
Zac was great! Quick and easy introduction to apartment- and made his self available for any questions during the trip. 
Highly recommend this listing. "
8371484,61628369,2016-02-07,9481750,Thomas,"We really loved the location and feel in this loft.  Everything was easy, from checkin meeting Zac, all the carefully appointed appliances to checkout.  We had a great time in Portland and this loft was integral!"

"
8371484,62101402,2016-02-11,15791290,Leslie,"Fumi met me at the apartment to give me a tour and show me how everything worked.  I was traveling for business, and the apartment was only a 2 block walk to my office, with a coffee shop on the way!  I stayed in Portland over the weekend, so having a washer/dryer when I got to Zac & Fumi's was a lifesaver.  The neighborhood felt very safe (exterior doors to the building are always locked) and there were a lot of options for food, coffee, and drinks within walking distance.  The apartment is beautifully finished and so homey, all the appliances are top-notch, and the balcony is such a great touch!  I will definitely be back."
8371484,62510986,2016-02-15,43593722,Kim And Andy,Zac showed us around the loft and made recommedations for bars and restaurants. The loft was beautiful and central to everything. We will definitely be back.
8371484,64614643,2016-03-06,15789735,Carrington,"Zac was easily accessible by text and met me at the apartment when I arrived. He was kind, helpful and showed me around the apartment. He made me feel at home and gave me ideas about what to do in the area. The apartment was just as the pictures described. The decor was fabulous, amenities perfect, bed and pillows cozy and in the best location in the city. I highly recommend renting this wonderful place. "
8371484,65228890,2016-03-12,55469545,Yuting,"Amazing Pearl is truly amazing. It is located in a renovated historical industrial building in the Pearl District--my favorite area in Portland, with stylish and distinctive interior design. When you step out of the building, you will find awesome restaurants and bars within 2 minutes' walk. (A restaurant that I strongly recommend is called Khao San--gorgeous Thai food omg!!) There are also lots of interesting and artsy stores around. The Pearl District will surprise you, trust me.

Zac and Fumi are great hosts. They contacted us three days prior to our arrival to coordinate check-in. They were also very responsive to our special request upon our leaving. They have put lots of efforts into cleaning up the apartment. The kitchen is fully-equipped 1000+, with all kinds of appliances and tablewares(beautiful wine glasses). Ah, please please go through the 'secret access' and enjoy the private balcony of the apartment--you will see everything you want to see. 

Amazing Pearl~home sweet home. I will definitely come back one day :) "
8371484,65787322,2016-03-17,21747551,Ken,"The condo was exactly as advertised. Very comfortable, clean, secure and a fantastic location. We did not need any additional help with the condo because Fumi's welcoming explanation provided all we needed."
8371484,66554066,2016-03-23,35009379,Quin,Loved the apartment and neighborhood. Perfect spot for walking around the Pearl and downtown. 
8371484,67028350,2016-03-26,6129858,Anne,Fumi met us at the building and welcomed us. The home is perfection. The area is ideal. I would stay here again. 
8371484,67849119,2016-03-31,34556070,Robyn,Our host was very welcoming. The description and photos were perfect. The location was excellent.
8371484,70591963,2016-04-18,61455166,Kiersten,"The place was exactly what we were looking for. Location was convenient to many great bars and restaurants, as well as easy to find. We were also happy to use and have access to the rooftop with a lovely view. Overall the place was clean, convenient and comfortable. Additionally there was a issue with the building the host was easy to contact and quick to respond. "
8371484,71784202,2016-04-28,43795451,Chelsea,"Zac and Fumi's loft was amazing! My husband and I loved the Pearl District location... close to awesome coffee shops/restaurants/bars/shops/sights, and wonderfully walkable to other parts of Portland! In addition to being entertaining, the neighborhood is safe. We felt comfortable walking around in the evening and early morning hours. 

The loft itself is gorgeous... but most importantly, clean and comfortable. We especially appreciated the stocked kitchen... if you want to cook, you'll find everything you need here! The many plants in the apartment gave a great contrast to the otherwise modern industrial decor. Zac was also very flexible with check-in, and understanding when we were delayed (thanks, Zac!). 

This place had everything we needed, and definitely felt like a home away from home. We wished we could have stayed!"
8371484,72293878,2016-05-01,8837478,Michelle,"What a gem! It was AWESOME. We loved the location, the convenience of restaurants, bars, coffee shops and shopping right outside our door. The little patio was a great place to soak up the sun and enjoy a cocktail after a long day of shopping. The bed was super comfortable, slept like a baby :-). This loft doesn't disappoint, it has all the amenities one can wish for and Zac & Fumi wonderful hosts. They were flexible meeting us upon arrival as we were very delayed. Also responsive to any questions we had throughout our weekend. I will definitely return when I revisit Portland."
8371484,72745612,2016-05-04,4741110,John,"So much more amazing than I had anticipated. This building, the loft apartment, the street, the neighborhood....all of it exceeded the pictures. Highly recommend, and I so want to go back. 
John from Miami Beach"
8371484,73896798,2016-05-11,64966729,Alex,"Zac and Fumi's place is an absolute dream. Clean, welcoming, and situated in the Pearl District, a hip and walkable enclave of shops, restaurants and bars that was a welcome hub for a first-time PDXer like myself.

And the hosts themselves were nothing short of a dream. Fumi was able to accommodate my arriving a bit later than anticipated and Zac was very responsive late in the trip regarding a small maintenance issue that they had notified me of far in advance and were in the process of fixing. An unrivaled Airbnb experience."
8371484,74885341,2016-05-17,48367403,Robert,"Zac was waiting for us with the key as we arrived with a friendly hello, helped us into the building and showed us around the apt. which we immediately liked. The view and location was perfect as well as the interior of the apt. The building was very quiet as well as the location, on the 3rd floor with a view of the West Hills. Great coffee across the street at Barista, and the best breakfast in Portland around the corner at Byways cafe with a friendly staff. "
8371484,75574745,2016-05-22,50150036,Mike,Wonderful stay! The loft is the ideal place to stay in the pearl district! High end secure building. The perfect location. Wonderful views from the rooftop deck. The place was very unique and comfortable. Great little balcony off the kitchen. Walkable to everything. Would love to stay here again! Bed is extremely comfortable. Miss it already! Strongly recommend this home. 
8371484,76762308,2016-05-29,41770776,Brooke,"Our experience was absolutely perfect. Fumi was effortless to communicate with regarding our arrival and the loft even more chic and fabulous in person than in the pictures; slept amazing in the bed (and I'm kind of high maintenance with beds), Whole Foods two blocks away to get staples (although coffee and sugar and olive oil etc available) incredible location right in the middle of fantastic restaurants and breweries and shops. We walked everywhere and used the rail and occasional short Uber ride with ease. During our down time, my husband was obsessed with sitting on the little balcony to people watch, I read under a cozy throw on the super comfortable sectional. Literally the best Airbnb experience ever. Thank you!!!"
8371484,77672009,2016-06-02,2860190,Shaun,"Loved this place! Excellent location in Portland, close to all shops and restaurants. Beware, if you do drive, you'll need to feed the meter with money to park until it becomes free at 7pm on the street. The actual apartment though is well situated and Fumi was a gracious host. Thank you! "
8371484,78190335,2016-06-05,868067,Laura,Grest place in a fantastic location. Especially loved the little balcony overlooking the street. Great place to have a glass of wine.
8371484,78690198,2016-06-08,22009998,Cody And Libby,"We had an amazing time staying in this incredible loft. The loft is located in a great neighborhood with a plethora of shops and restaurants. The listing and pictures are very accurate and the loft is really just as aesthetically beautiful as the pictures show. Fumi checked us in and was very welcoming. The check-in was quick an easy and there was a binder with all of the information we needed for our stay. Fumi and Zac were very accommodating and made every effort to make our stay extraordinary. 

They were incredible hosts and we would recommend staying in their loft if you are planning to visit Portland. "
8371484,79421735,2016-06-12,28567647,Shane,The loft was great and in a perfect location to explore the neighborhoods.  Would definitely stay here again.
1917542,9176997,2013-12-10,9761836,Jessica,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Sun House!  It's very private and comfortable.  The bed is comfortable and the decor in both the living room and bedroom is great.  The kitchenette is handy and I really appreciated the selection of tea. There is good coffee there too.
Stuart is a considerate and responsive host, who also left me the privacy I was looking for.
The Sun House is a great deal and I would definitely stay here again!"
1917542,9337412,2013-12-22,1188278,Liz,"Stuart was a great host. He has a wonderful new home decorated to the ""T"". Stuart thought of everything from a hair dryer, shampoo, an umbrella, and both a kettle and coffee maker. The house is in a quiet neighborhood with great restaurants nearby. Parking wasn't a problem either."
1917542,9531054,2014-01-01,10765784,Oliver,"The place was simply perfect; clean, warm and inviting private space that was cozily furnished. Stuart made it comfortable, was very friendly and accommodating , quickly responding to correspondence during our pleasant stay.  He gave excellent recommendations for food, drinks, and local attractions. We felt like locals in this residential neighborhood - supermarket, pubs, eateries, yoga, and public transportation all conveniently around the corner."
1917542,9630059,2014-01-03,3738988,Carina,"Stuart was an excellent host - and a great decorator! The space is perfect for a stay in Portland in the NE Neighborhood. Close to restaurants, bars etc. Would definitely stay here again..."
1917542,9859863,2014-01-14,924597,Kiki,"Stuart's listing is absolutely adorable! It's clean and well organized; he's done a great job utilizing the space! The Checkin and Checkout was so easy and Stuart is super communicative and was available to us at anytime if we were to need anything. The location of the listing is also awesome! Close to shopping, breakfast places, coffee, etc. The bed was super comfortable and there was plenty of hot water. It was the perfect space for two people and I think we could have even fit a third person comfortably as well (on the fold out couch). Also, plenty of street parking if you have a car. I would highly suggest this little gem to anyone staying in Portland, we can't wait to come back!"
1917542,9977298,2014-01-22,10448006,Maria,"We loved our stay at the Sun House. Checkin was super easy, the suite was super clean, welcoming and comfortable, and was everything we expected and more from the description and photos shown. It's also close to everything needed once you go out and explore, and it's not located far from Downtown. Stuart was great, responsive, and was really helpful with suggestions; he was thoughtful and went out of his way to accommodate us and our schedule.
Netflix was also a treat to have for when there is some downtime.
Overall, it was a good experience and we would stay at the Sun House again."
1917542,10074998,2014-01-28,4353511,Mary,"Stuarts place is lovely! It was a great find and a real gem. Clean, neat and cozy and in a great location. It was perfect for our 3 day stay in Portland, and we are a family of 4. Our kids were more than happy on the sleeper couch and our bed was just marvellous. The apartment had almost everything we could need for a few days stay, the only downside is that there is no 'real' kitchen so washing up needs to happen in the bathroom - not a big deal, especially when you are only there for a few days, but worth noting if you need it. We loved out stay and would happily stay there again if in Portland. It is great value for money and SO much better than a hotel!! Thank you Stuart for the care you put into everything, all the small touches are noticed, and it was great to have you so willing to help and offer advice on where to go, etc. The fruit bowl was a lovely touch (and such good fruit)!"
1917542,10160587,2014-02-03,3762865,Caleb,The Sun House is a great little place to stay in a nice Portland neighborhood. It is incredibly quiet (we heard birds in the morning instead of traffic) and comfortable. I would recommend Stuart's place to anyone. I'll definitely look to book here again next time I'm in Portland. Thanks Stuart!
1917542,10312429,2014-02-12,11373599,Eileen,"Stuart was a wonderful host!  The rooms were bright, cozy, and very clean.  He made me and my friends' stay very comfortable.  He is very attentive, as he kept us up to date and offered us assistance when there was a snow storm.  This was one of our most enjoyable stays.  

His accommodation offered us lots of ways to pass the time in the poor weather.  There were plenty of board games, books, tourism magazines and Netflix.  

In the event the snow got really bad, it was nice to have markets/restaurants/shops that were within short walking distance.  

We also appreciated that he allowed us to play with the cat upstairs, while keeping the suite animal-free for those who may have allergies (me).  :)

We will definitely stay again on our future trips to Portland."
1917542,10424524,2014-02-18,9020816,Lizzie,We stayed at the Sun House Private Suite for a couple days while visiting Portland and couldn't have been happier with the place. It was very cozy and comfortable with all the amenities we needed which were just as described in the listing. The suite was decorated nicely and made us feel right at home. It was the perfect location if you are staying in Portland as there were easy means of transportation as well as being close to various well known restaurants/bars/breweries/coffee shops/etc...Stuart was a wonderful host and we would most definitely return next time we are in Portland. We would highly recommend the Sun House to our friends and anyone looking for an affordable and great place. 
1917542,10540914,2014-02-24,11340053,Colton,"Stewart was a great host. He was very responsive when he was needed and his house was perfect for a 1 to 2 person stay. The house was well prepared and had some nice features (he provides Netflix!), and Steward was friendly, accommodating, and helpful."
1917542,10587317,2014-02-26,11103230,Tamara,"Stuart was great! He communicated well with us before and during our trip and made sure we were comfortable. It was raining in Portland when we were there and he made sure to bring us some extra umbrellas in case we needed them. I felt like he went above and beyond to ensure that we were satisfied with our accommodations. The Sun House was very comfortable and was the perfect place to relax after a long day exploring the city. I would definitely stay here again if I find myself in Portland. Thanks, Stuart!"
1917542,10721318,2014-03-04,10961348,Mike,"The Sun House attracted us due to its location near our daughter's home. We did not intend to use it any differently than a hotel room. It met our needs perfectly. Easy access, friendly landlord, comfortable bed, quiet location and coffee were a few of our pluses. Since we did not plan to have meals there, the lack of a ""kitchen"" was not an issue. We would recommend Stuart and his Sun House to anyone wanting a hotel room and more in NE Portland."
1917542,10815097,2014-03-09,10106440,Amir,"Stuart was a wonderful host and was able to welcome my girlfriend and I to our first visit to Portland. The place was equipped with a small and functional living room, mini-fridge, a queen sized bed, spacious dressing area (with dresser), and clean bathroom. There is a roku equipped with Netflix to enjoy movies as well. Location wise, the Sun House is close to the heart of the city and only a 5-10 minute drive from most bars / restaurants in the area. 

Loved the place and the city. I would definitely recommend this place for any individuals who are considering visiting, much better in my opinion than many hotels. "
1917542,10940443,2014-03-14,10508603,Claudia,"Stuart's place is great! I've really only had positive experiences with airbnb but Stuart's place takes it up a notch as it comes with a nice sitting space, coffee and a refrigerator. Stuart even got in touch before my stay to ask how I take my coffee so he could make sure to have creamer or half and half in the fridge for me! His place is comfortable and private and he was easy to communicate with. Highly recommend if you're looking for something in NE Portland. "
1917542,11219519,2014-03-25,12037203,Victor,Stuart was a great host. He was very friendly and helpful. He stopped by to say hello in person and had many recommendations for restuarants in the area. The sun house was clean and tidy and everything was exactly as described. We would definitely stay again.
1917542,11320010,2014-03-30,11337349,Elena,"Stuart was an amazing host! I had conference at the Portland Convention center and wanted a little more comfort than the typical hotel. Stuart had everything set for me and the space was warm and cozy. The coffee was delicious and he was generous enough to give cream and sugar to go with it. In addition, he left a few healthy snacks. The place was very clean and had all I needed for a week away from home. The suite was a quick and easy bus ride away from the convention center. I would recommend this place to anyone. Stuart is very friendly and lets you decide how much interaction you'd like to have. I only wish I got to see the friendly kitty. "
1917542,11423519,2014-04-01,1276309,George,"Really lovely basement apartment in a nice part of town, only a short distance to Mississippi and Alberta, and not too far from downtown.
Stuart was a very thoughtful and generous host.
We had a great time."
1917542,11470635,2014-04-04,8781904,John,"This was a great space‚¶ private and quiet in a great neighborhood. Stuart was a great host, very helpful. Just a mile walk away there are several nice restaurants. The Metro bus is very convenient, just a few blocks away. It's in a charming neighborhood. Stuart really went out of his way to make my stay easy and comfortable"
1917542,11557325,2014-04-07,807632,Kathleen,We had a great stay and really enjoyed meeting Stuart. The suite is very comfortable and clean and has everything you need. It was a great location for me as my conference was just down the road at the hospital. The rest of the time we walked around easily and found plenty to do. Bed was really comfy! Portland is a friendly and laid back place. Looking forward to another visit already!
1917542,11653251,2014-04-10,4676582,Maryanne,"We had a fabulous time at the Sun House, and the apartment was very cute, cozy, and clean. I was traveling with a 16-year-old exchange student; the fold-out couch in the living room allowed me to have plenty of privacy in the bedroom and was still super comfortable for her. Best of all, we were less than a 10-minute bike ride into the Pearl Distinct and Downtown Portland on designated bike paths (by bike is the best way to see Portland!), so never had to fuss with a car while there. I highly recommend this flat, and would definitely book it again the next time I visit Portland. "
1917542,11710436,2014-04-13,5135302,Emma,"We had a great time at the Sunhouse! It's an adorable and clean little apartment. The place is in a great neighbourhood and easily accessible by bus. Stuart was a great host, very informative and friendly! "
1917542,11841956,2014-04-16,13620614,Megumi,"Staying at the Sun House Suite was lovely.  Stuart, the host, was very hospitable and very nice.  We spoke briefly and he as very personable.  He took out the time to give me recommendations on places to eat and things to do.  The place was very clean and quiet.  Some places are also stuffy but this place had good circulation.  I would definitely stay here again!  Thank you Stuart for a very nice time!"
1917542,12004370,2014-04-21,7874199,April,"Stuart's suite is impeccably clean and and the rooms look like they were just remodeled. Since there are several rooms, we had much more space than we would have had in a hotel room but were just as comfortable. We especially appreciated the walkability, and the quiet neighborhood is so beautiful in the spring, full of trees and flowers. It was great to have a mini fridge to hold our farmers market acquisitions! Easy street parking, too."
1917542,12138875,2014-04-23,5524742,Cheyenne,"My friend and I had a really pleasant stay at Stuart's Sun House. Stuart communicated quickly and clearly beforehand and we couldn't have asked for a sweeter place.
"
1917542,12256854,2014-04-27,11363544,Maria,"My little family really enjoyed our time at the Sun House. Stuart was a terrific host. He gave timely responses, had coffee/tea and healthy snacks awaiting our arrival, and was super friendly to chat with. He had great local advice for us and sent us to the coolest kid friendly restaurant we've been to since having kiddos. The suite was perfect. Very clean, comfortable and spacious. There were interesting books, local maps and fun board games in the suite. Stuart's cat is adorable, friendly and super patient with little hands! The neighborhood is great. It's quiet enough to relax and get a good nights rest, but also very walkable to some really good stuff. There are fantastic restaurants, fun shops and cool bars a short distance away by feet. There's also Irving Park, which has a fun playground, close by if you're traveling with a kid or two. And the walk to all of these places is beautiful - adorable houses on tree lined streets full of flowers.
I would definitely recommend staying at the Sun House if you ever find yourself in Portland. "
1917542,12338630,2014-04-29,5200330,Heidi,Sweet place to stay. Fun neighborhood.
1917542,12978656,2014-05-16,7882443,Lindsay,"The Sun House was perfect for our short stay in Portland. Great location, nice clean and well decorated space, and very attentive host. Thanks for having us!"
1917542,13043699,2014-05-18,14634146,Sylvia,Stuart was super friendly and accommodating to all of my requests. He went above and beyond to keep me comfortable and able to enjoy Portland as much as possible during my first visit to this area. The location was very convenient for my meetings at the Oregon Convention Center and going into downtown. I would highly recommend staying at the Sun House.
1917542,13304361,2014-05-25,12001082,Hannah,"I had a fantastic stay at the Sun House! It was very cozy and comfortable, and the location couldn't have been more convenient. I'd stay here again anytime. Stuart is very friendly and helpful and made our stay very pleasant."
1917542,13418719,2014-05-27,658493,John,"Stuart was the perfect host; patiently answering all our questions and accommodating our special requests.  The space was even better than advertised.  We are host parents for international students and our party included a high school sophomore from Korea.  She was happy to have her private space in the front room with two doors between our bedroom and hers.  
Sun House is set in a quiet neighborhood of century-old homes within walking distance of downtown Portland.  It's uphill coming back, so you may prefer the 9 minute cab- or 15 minute bus-ride.  Bridges Caf√© is three short blocks away, serves wonderful breakfast all day and is across the street from a Nike outlet store.  Also nearby is the legendary Wonder Ballroom.  We failed to check the schedule when we booked Sun House and missed our chance to see Maya Rudolph and Gretchen Lieberum performing Princess (a gender-flipped homage to Prince)."
1917542,13606384,2014-06-01,13028544,April,"My stay at the Sun House absolutely exceeded my expectations. 
It was very spacious, exceptionally clean and a great location.
Stuart was the perfect host, his attention to detail makes this a very cozy stay away from home."
1917542,13816700,2014-06-05,4160920,Ruth,"Our stay in the Sun House was great.  The space was just as described...only better!  Clean, modern and comfortable.  Stuart was helpful without being intrusive and I will definitely try to book the Sun House again when I return to Portland. "
1917542,13895265,2014-06-07,16073647,Andy,"Stuart was a tremendous host. He kept in contact before I arrived to make sure everything was okay, and even asked me if I preferred cream or milk for my coffee and tea!

He provided great recommendations for places to eat, and also responded in a timely manner when I reached out to him. The neighbourhood was very nice; a lot of places were in walk-able distance. "
1917542,13955727,2014-06-09,4997371,Robyn,"We loved our stay at Stuart's Sun House private suite during our two night stay in early June and would not hesitate to recommend it as a home base for enjoying Portland. 

Stuart was a great communicator and made the whole experience easy for us. He provided great instructions (directions to the suite, the lock box, etc.) and was very thoughtful - making sure there were emergency contacts and extra keys for when he was away, asking us if we'd like cream or milk for our coffee/tea. 

Speaking of which, it was great having a mini fridge and coffee to wake up to. :)  It's in a residential area, so very quiet at night. Although there were people in the upstairs suite, we felt that we had tons of privacy. Netflix on TV was a bonus, and the free WIFI came in handy for looking up transit schedules and nearby restaurants. The neighbourhood's very cool as well - stumbling distance to many great restaurants, bars, and unique shops, including Toro Bravo (Barcelona-inspired tapas), Secret Society Lounge (classic cocktails), and Tasty & Sons (amazing brunch). We even walked to Lower Burnside in about 20 minutes, and quick transit into downtown Portland was nearby and affordable.

This wasn't my first time to Portland, but it was my first time staying and exploring NE Portland. If you're looking for a way to experience Portland as the locals do, I highly recommend the Sun House suite."
1917542,14157038,2014-06-13,5384756,Stephanie,"We had a great time at Stuart's apartment! It's very clean, cosy and covers all the basic needs. It's located in a nice, quiet neighborhood with plenty of parking space. Stuart is a great host, he is very friendly, considerate and respectful; and communication was always fast and easy. I highly recommend his place!"
1917542,14686604,2014-06-24,14412420,Joseph,Stuart was my host for the Sun House. Stuart left very clear instructions on finding the house and key to get in. Upon arriving he was there to greet us and we were welcomed into the clean and cozy Sun House. As expected there was a room with one bed and a couch with a pull out bed. There were plenty of travel books and brochures which is a thoughtful idea especially if it's your first visit to Portland. The only minor hiccup we experienced was that we had a problem with the wifi however Stuart was very quick to get the issue resolved. The house is in a peaceful quiet neighborhood with easy access to public transit. I would definitely stay again in the future.
1917542,15060728,2014-07-01,16546108,Danielle,"My sister and I stayed at Sun House and it was just perfect for the two of us! Great location within walking distance to great shops and restaurants.  Sun House was a lovely apartment, very clean, cozy and welcoming. Stuart was a great host and asked us to let him know if we needed anything at all.  I highly recommend staying here and I would for sure do so again myself in the future!"
1917542,15213778,2014-07-05,14381738,Christopher,"The Sun House was a great place to stay. Stuart is a conscientious host the Sun House is very clean and nicely decorated with guide books and Stuarts own book of recommendations.  

The Sun House is located in a great area of Portland that most visitors might not get to visit. There are many good restaurants close by. It is close to public transportation and bike routes. There is also ample street parking for visitors with cars. "
1917542,16064235,2014-07-21,7983779,Catie,"Our time at the Sun House was wonderful!  The neighborhood had a nice sleepy feel.  The directions were easy to follow.  The suite itself was cozy and inviting, and there was so much information provided on local restaurants, breweries, activities, etc.  As this was our first trip to Portland, this was very helpful to us!  Having coffee supplied was great as well.  There was ample room to house all of our belongings that we brought with us.  

We ran into Stuart as we were getting back the first night, and he was extremely friendly and helpful.  We had zero issues, and did not have to contact Stuart for any problems or help.  He did make sure to let us know that he was just a phone call away.

Did I mention the bed?  It was SO comfortable!  The entire suite had a homey, welcoming vibe without being cluttered.  We spent very little time there aside from sleeping and showering, but there were plenty of books and games to keep you entertained if you happened to hang around.

I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about Stuart and the Sun House.  We had an extremely positive experience, and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
1917542,16225354,2014-07-23,17885847,Sarah,"Our host made us feel very welcome during our stay at the Sun House Suite in Portland. Stuart was great and provided us with an information book highlighting the area with recommendations for restaurants, bars, and wine-tasting rooms. Throughout our stay he was available for questions. 

The accommodations were lovely! The whole suite was very tastefully decorated with a very comfortable bed and fold-out couch. The suite also had excellent guide books of the surrounding area, games, fresh fruit and coffee, and other small nice touches to help us feel at home.

We highly recommend the Sun Suite for anyone looking to experience a hip, up and coming neighborhood of Portland that is just a short train-ride from the downtown hustle and bustle. "
1917542,16466977,2014-07-28,6170035,Jennifer,"Stuart was a fantastic host!  His accommodations were the perfect spot for us to hang our hat for our long weekend Portland trip!  His place is super clean, cute and has everything you would need....including a blow dryer!  And yes...the bed as mentioned in other (URL HIDDEN) quite awesome!

Stuart checked in from time to time to see if we had any questions, needed any pointers for places to go etc.  He has put together an awesome guide book for local attractions, pubs, restaurants etc.  His spot is centrally located to many neighborhoods including downtown.
He even provides local coffee and creamer to help get your day started.

We'll be back!"
1917542,16623979,2014-07-30,3452994,Rachael,"We had a great time at Stuart's place.  He left us a note, guidebooks, and a homemade binder of info.  We came in very late, so we didn't meet the first day, but we felt very in touch.  The place is immaculate!  As well as very comfortable and well appointed.  We'd stay here again in a heartbeat.  "
1917542,16984313,2014-08-05,15741265,Berto,"The Sun House was the perfect place to stay during our Portland trip. Stuart was an excellent host even though we did not get the opportunity to meet in person while we were there. He communicated with us from beginning to end and made sure we had an enjoyable and comfortable experience. The pictures do not deceive! It was bright, VERY clean, and decorated very tastefully. The mattress was very comfortable. Stuart provided fresh fruit & local coffee for us to enjoy. The coffee was amazing, by the way. He had all the amenities of a hotel room available (and then some!) which was very thoughtful. There is also a giant mirror outside the bathroom which was useful when we were getting ready. One thing I do want to mention was that the shower was excellent. Clean and great water pressure. I cannot tell you how many terrible showers I have used in hotels. We truly felt at home at the Sun House- there were even books and board games for us to enjoy.

We were lucky to enjoy clear, hot days during our stay in PDX. The temp got up to 90 degrees during our stay, and due to it's tucked-away location, the Sun House stayed cool the entire time (bonus!). I noticed there was an umbrella by the door- very thoughtful. Glad we didn't need to use it!

The Sun House is located close to pretty much everything in PDX. We stayed downtown our first night and spent only $13 on a cab to the Sun House. We also used Car2Go during our stay which was easy (Your membership works in all C2G cities!). If you need to rent a car, the Sun House is within ""pick up"" range of the Lloyd Center Enterprise and there is plenty of parking around. As mentioned in the description, Sun House is within walking distance of many restaurants & bars. I would recommend Russel Street BBQ (we ate there twice!) and Bunk Bar. 

We opted to take the TriMet back to the airport on our last day which was VERY easy & convenient. $2.50 to get to the airport? Yes, please. There is a bus stop within blocks of the Sun House which will take you to the nearest Red Line light rail station which will take you straight to the PDX Airport terminals. 

We cannot wait to return to Portland and the Sun House! Thank you Stuart, of an excellent Airbnb experience. 
"
1917542,17517400,2014-08-13,17945048,Frances,"Three of us stayed at the Sun House for two nights. The place was super clean and cozy (a tad small for three adults but doable), Stuart had left a handwritten welcome note and coffee, tea, and milk for us, and it was clear that thought and care had gone into the furnishing and decoration of the suite. The neighbourhood is quiet, a few short pleasant blocks from bus stops (a very short ride from downtown) and a lovely park, but restaurants ad bars could be found a short walk from the Sun House. A meal at the close by Russell St. BBQ is highly recommended!"
1917542,17743857,2014-08-17,13280389,Heather,"Stuart was very welcoming and thoughtful. Even through we arrived very late at night he helped us with our luggage and made sure we were settled in the Sun House.  He went out of his way with the small details like providing us with a list of local restaurant menus and also providing us with almond milk for coffee.  I've got to say that the bed was super comfortable, I hadn't slept that well in a long time! The neighborhood was very charming and inviting. No traffic, private and quite."
1917542,18313116,2014-08-25,17074179,Matt,We had a great stay at the 'Sun House'. Everything was very clean and the Decor was pleasant. This place is less than a mile from the Mississippi district which was a lot of fun to explore. Overall I would consider staying here again. 
1917542,19229595,2014-09-08,15969432,Manuel,"We stayed with Stuart for two nights in his place in Portland. The flat is nicely decorated and comes exactly as described. Stuart was able to provide us with a series of good recommendations upon arrival and tons of further information are available in the form of guides and nicely made sheets.

I would recommend the flat anybody traveling with up to 3 people, looking for fairly priced accomodation close to everything in Portland."
1917542,19339727,2014-09-10,20669445,Elizabeth,"The listing description was accurate.  The pictures gave us a great idea of what to expect.  The directions to the house were fantastic and it was easy to access.  We didn't explore too much of the immediate surrounding area, but it was close to a very nice park for children and just down the street from a great strip of restaurants and bars.  We took the owner's recommendation for a breakfast spot, and it was outstanding!  All in all, the place was a great value for us, Stuart was a communicative and accommodating host, and we'd happily stay in the apartment the next time we are in Portland."
1917542,19448477,2014-09-12,21110453,Jason,I definitely enjoyed my stay at Sun House. Everything is new and comfortable. Stuart was a great host - he was sure to check to make sure everything was going well.
1917542,20439442,2014-09-29,2013489,Julia,"The Sun House was a great place to stay for our visit to Portland. It was easy to find and access. Stuart communicated well through text and allowed us to leave our bags with him after checkout so we could continue exploring. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed - towels, hair dryers, iron, fruit etc. The pullout couch was great for our 3rd guest. Having the key in the lockbox also facilitated checkin/out. The area was quiet and felt safe. It was relatively well connected to bus routes. You could also walk to some fun restaurants and areas. Thanks Stuart!"
1917542,20694912,2014-10-04,19812530,Hanna,Stuart was a great host! The room description was definitely accurate and actually a lot bigger than the pictures show. Very clean and the decor was very cute! The Sun House is not too close to downtown but if you don't mind taking the bus and public transportation - it is perfect! I would definitely recommend the Sun House Suite! 
1917542,20829595,2014-10-06,14266559,David,"We had an amazing time in Portland. Stuart's Sun House Private Suite was perfect for our stay. The accommodation was very clean and comfortable, and a good size for the three of us. The neighbourhood has great eateries and bars, however also has a relaxed and peaceful feel. It is very close to downtown, easily within walking distance. Stuart was the perfect host, warmly welcomed us and gave us a few tips for our stay, then left us to our own devices. If we return to Portland in the future we would without doubt stay here again. Thanks very much Stuart!"
1917542,21204933,2014-10-13,8897483,Autumn,"Our host Stuart made us feel welcome with little details like fresh organic fruit to enjoy, coffee, tea and our choice of milk (soy for us) and his communication about the property, neighborhood, directions and entry were impeccable.  The property is as cute and well cared for as the photos show with every amenity we needed, fantastic water pressure and most importantly to us very clean.  It's important to note that this is NOT a dank, cold basement apartment but a very private, cozy street level one bedroom.   As a family of three we were very comfortable staying there and will do so again when in Portland.   The neighborhood is very walk-able.  We enjoyed mornings walks to a sweet coffee shop nearby and looking at all the historic homes along beautiful tree lined streets.  You cannot go wrong staying here."
1917542,21714230,2014-10-22,20913825,Nicole,"What a welcoming suite! Stuart was a wonderful host, thoughtful enough to leave coffee, milk and some fruit out for our stay. There was a great guide book with local restaurant information and plenty of books about the area. Stuart's neighborhood proved to be a lovely location for our stay- easily accessible to downtown, cute shopping neighborhoods and plenty of dining options. "
1917542,21873734,2014-10-26,4587093,Carrie,Staying at the Sun House was a wonderful experience. It is private and cozy and located in a great Portland neighborhood. Stuart was very accommodating. I am grateful for his flexibility with checkin and checkout times that worked around my schedule. I would highly recommend the Sun House to anyone traveling to Portland.
1917542,22664111,2014-11-11,9060056,Jerry,"The Sun House is a great place to stay in Portland.  It's near bus lines and MAX light rail which can take you to and from the airport as well as to downtown Portland.  There's also a variety of restaurants near the place which Stuart thoughtfully put in a visitor guide for us.  Stuart was kind enough to provide us with everything we needed for an enjoyable stay, which included towels, fruit, hot tea, and Netflix on the TV.  Overall this was a great place to stay and I would recommend anyone looking for a place a stay in Portland to give this place a try."
1917542,23711010,2014-12-08,1605121,Kelly,What a great little spot! We took the transit from the airport which was super easy. Directions to the suite were a little tricky the first time but Stuart made sure to do everything he could to make it make sense. The location was absolutely perfect! Walkable everywhere and super close to transit stops when we needed to go a bit further. The unit was super duper clean and the bedding was super comfy. Thanks for making our first Portland trip a great one! Can't wait to come back! :)
1917542,23871477,2014-12-13,22866021,Mary,"We loved this spot! The suite is exactly as described and the pictures are spot on. No surprises there. The suite was very clean and tidy. It felt very comfortable and cozy for our stay. The bed was quite comfortable and there were extra pillows and blankets available. Stuart was an awesome host, checking in with us when needed and letting us know about a possible power outage (luckily that didn't occur). The location is very close to Downtown Portland and everything was within just a few minutes of this spot. I don't think we could have picked a more perfect spot. "
1917542,24010771,2014-12-16,24092340,Judith,"This is a fantastic to place to stay in Portland!  The apartment is clean and lovely, and Stuart made sure that we had everything we needed.  We really appreciated the tips and Portland tourist information he had available.  "
1917542,24281183,2014-12-24,6433755,Feng Yi,"The Sun House was amazing! It was a little apartment all to ourselves, with a small living room, a nook with a fridge/dishes, and a bedroom with attached bathroom and space for luggage and clothes. The location was perfect (it seemed like just about all the places we ended up going to in Portland were only 10min away at the most). There were many good restaurants in the vicinity. 

Stuart was an attentive host who made sure that we got in okay and were comfortable throughout the stay. We really appreciated his hospitality and were sorry that our schedules did not allow us to meet him to thank him! Our trip in Portland was very memorable and we would love to stay in his place if we return again. "
1917542,24535859,2014-12-30,7951711,Gabrielle,"This place is cozy and has all the amenities needed for our stay. The hypoallergenic bed is a huge plus, and the interior is welcoming and quirky (decorations of owls everywhere!). I enjoyed my stay and would recommend this to anybody staying at Portland. "
1917542,24752382,2015-01-02,24418030,Kevin,"Our stay at the Sun House was wonderful. The space was clean, cozy and welcoming (love all the owls!). Stuart provided fresh fruit and our choice of creamer for our coffee and tea--nice touch!

He was also very responsive--when we had a minor power outage at the place, Stuart was not home initially but was there within the hour after we called and quickly fixed the issue.

Thanks Stuart for providing us with a great little haven during our trip to Portland."
1917542,25553748,2015-01-19,9235863,Emily,"Super clean, bright, and was a wonderful stay. As advertised the kitchen-type facilities are minimal, but for our needs (storing leftovers, making tea/coffee) it was perfect. Nice storage space for luggage between the bedroom/bathroom, and was overall a very cozy place to stay - wonderful!"
1917542,25653781,2015-01-22,22291149,Edan,"The Sun House was a perfect choice for our trip to Portland. It is outside the hustle and bustle of the city, but close enough where you can get pretty much anywhere you want in about thirty minutes. It was very comfortable and spacious; the photos are extremely accurate. Stuart was a great host and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Although it is in the basement, it is very quiet--we could barely hear anyone upstairs. We were extremely comfortable here and will definitely be staying here next time we come back to Portland! I would definitely recommend this house for anyone wanting a quiet, comfortable place to stay. 

Edan"
1917542,26219729,2015-02-07,26327094,Veronica,"The suite was very comfortable and clean. Stuart was kind enough to let us check in a bit early, which was very helpful to drop off our luggage. We were able to walk many places and the neighborhood was beautiful. The small water heater was great for tea, and the mini fridge and microwave were perfect for storing and re-heating our leftovers. Stuart was very responsive with my questions and the room provided plenty of storage space for our clothes. I was able to meet Stuart briefly at the end while I was catching a taxi to the airport- he is very friendly and helpful!"
1917542,26823498,2015-02-20,453622,Luis,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Sun House. Stuart is a great host and provided us with a wonderful experience. The location is really great with a number of places to eat nearby. He provides a great list and also has a number of resources for sight seeing. We would stay here again! 
"
1917542,27253391,2015-03-01,4715979,Therese,"The location was fantastic.  We went to a Portland Trailblazers game and walked from the Sun House, which was great considering all the traffic and parking before and after the game, which we didn't have to deal with.  Loved walking the neighborhood with the gracious, classic, interesting older homes.  We had coffee at a couple of great places, dinner at a fabulous BBQ joint and breakfast at a great diner all within walking distance.  The place was very clean and comfortable.  The bed was super comfy. The check-in and check-out was seamless and the host had fruit, coffee and tea available.  Really enjoyed our stay at the Sun House."
1917542,27435197,2015-03-04,15543216,Jeff,"A really nice, quiet place to stay. Stuart was communicative and helpful in providing all of the necessary details on the place. The apartment was nicely appointed and exactly what I was looking for while visiting Portland for a conference. My only qualm was all of the requirements of the guest when leaving the (URL HIDDEN) seemed like it should have been the host's responsibility to strip the bed and collect the towels from the bathroom. But hey, that's just me."
1917542,27663402,2015-03-09,13668636,Ryan,Great place to relax in portland
1917542,28130766,2015-03-18,15347066,Baiwei,"Stuart is a nice host. His advice is pretty helpful and informative. No matter what problem you meet, he will try his best to help you. The room was also worth its price. I can say this is the best airbnb I have booked, and strongly recommend you guys book it."
1917542,28226031,2015-03-20,4344614,Kelly,"A great, central place to stay in Portland! I was able to park and walk from the house to the convention center, shops and restaurants. A very quick 2 mile drive to downtown attractions. Stuart was very accessible and willing to help. There is a binder and several books with information about the surrounding area which I found very helpful. The space was super clean and comfortable. I was traveling alone, but it would have also been a good space for my family since it was two rooms. "
1917542,29184419,2015-04-05,5656262,Manda,"Stuart was a great host providing us with directions from the airport prior to our arrival, great accommodations and the fresh fruit, milk/creamer and coffee/tea selection was a great touch!  Stuart was available throughout our stay and very accommodating. Thanks for having us in Portland! "
1917542,29567123,2015-04-09,4938166,Arend,"The Sun Room is a fantastic place to stay while visiting Portland. The location is quiet, provides great parking area and is near a multitude of shops on N. Williams. 
The space itself was spotless, well appointed and modern. The 2 rooms provide just enough space to feel really comfortable for multi-day trips. 
We never actually met Stuart, but he was in touch before and during our stay and we always had what we needed. 
A perfect experience, highly recommended!"
1917542,30123603,2015-04-18,10076027,Sabrina,We had a great experience at Stuart's place - it was immaculately clean and the location was AMAZING.  We were able to walk or take the bus to anywhere we wanted to be.  We will definitely try to stay there again when back in Portland.
1917542,30470066,2015-04-22,8409754,Tristan,"Beautiful area, clean, quiet, very comfortable accommodation. Stuart was great!"
1917542,32464168,2015-05-18,25853402,Andrea,"We loved staying at the Sun House! My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights and I wish we could have stayed longer. Check in was very convenient as we got in very late at night. The apartment is adorable! Nice and clean, looks newly remodeled. Super nice bathroom and very comfy bed. I loved the neighborhood, it was very homey feeling since it was outside of the city. But there were still bars, coffee shops, etc that were within walking distance. We even walked over the river into the pearl district and it was not too far. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this place!"
1917542,32966559,2015-05-24,26560007,Lauren,"My boyfriend and I came to Stuart's place for a three night stay. The apartment was very private, clean, and the bed was super comfy! You can't go wrong staying here. Stuart was very friendly and made himself available for any questions and concerns. The area around the apartment also had many shops, restaurants, and bars in walking distance. Overall we had a great stay, and would definitely recommend this location to anyone."
1917542,35827076,2015-06-22,19857246,Kelly,"My husband and I had a wonderful experience at the Sun House. It's in a great location. We were able to rent bikes for our few days there from a local bike rental place. I highly recommend renting bikes since it allowed us to check out most of Portland. 

The sun house was clean, quiet, and just what you need for a short vacation. We would defiantly stay there again. "
1917542,36517602,2015-06-29,7983779,Catie,"On our return trip to Portland, we had no doubts we would be staying at the Sun House Suite once again.  As expected, the suite was clean, well-prepared, and comfortable.  We were only there for sleeping and showers, and the latex mattress is pretty amazing!  There were plenty of towels for our stay, and we appreciated the nice touches of shampoos and soaps.  

We missed the opportunity to connect with Stuart on this trip, but hopefully next time we will be able to grab a cup of coffee with him!"
1917542,37634870,2015-07-09,11133586,Amy,"The Sun House was perfect for our trip to Portland! It is a wonderful space with plenty of room to accommodate two people, not to mention the location was fantastic! Stuart does a great job of keeping the space clean, and he was very helpful and responsive to our needs. Would definitely recommend staying here! Thanks Stuart!"
1917542,41247726,2015-08-05,11553030,Jillian,"Stuart's suite was great! It was clean and comfortable, and was in a nice neighborhood while still being convenient to what we wanted to do. The bathroom was especially nice! Full size with good water pressure. We did rent bikes, which was farther from the house than we had anticipated, but it was a nice walk and ride. The morning coffee was a lovely bonus. "
1917542,41618670,2015-08-08,35172126,Lindsay,"The Sun House was a wonderful place to stay during our trip to Portland! The space was homey - we loved the colours and owl decor! - and it was a good size for three people. Stuart was very friendly and accommodating, and the pamphlets and maps in the suite were really helpful for finding our way around the city. We would definitely stay there again!"
1917542,43306851,2015-08-18,40421485,Amy,"Everything about The Sun House was perfect.  Stuart was extremely helpful in providing detailed instructions that helped us settle in quickly.  The photos are a true representation of the home - it is extremely clean, bright, spacious and very comfortable.  We had a wonderful stay here and would certainly return if we are ever lucky enough to visit Portland again.  Thank you, Stuart!"
1917542,43520016,2015-08-20,38617430,Umaima,It was great staying at Stuart's. Everything was clean and very comfy. He was very accommodating and let us check in earlier than the proposed time since our flight was early. 
1917542,44139064,2015-08-24,36368806,Cathie,"Great place! Awesome location. We loved staying @ the SH. Stuart's got a great thing going here. 

Strong recommendations in the guidebook (which we used a bunch), good WiFi, ridiculously easily and well-conveyed checkin and checkout policies. Clean, and exceedingly accommodating. 

Look forward to staying again, and encouraging friends and fam to do so as well."
1917542,44438059,2015-08-26,38002232,Lauren,We had a great time at the Sun House! The room was so comfortable and Stuart was a welcoming and friendly host. It was a cozy place to come back to after long days of walking and exploring Northeast Portland.
1917542,44664155,2015-08-28,2480190,Manfred,"Stuart was an extremely easy, friendly and helpful host. His place was as new, well equipped and spotlessly clean. Overall, an extremely pleasant experience. Can only be recommended to anyone."
1917542,45308154,2015-09-01,575638,Mark,"Cute place in nice neighbourhood. Plenty of great restaurants within close walking distance. Checkin was a bit bumpy, as the lock box code had been changed without notifying us, but Stuart's girlfriend was home and quickly resolved the problem for us.  They were also helpful in recommending restaurants.  Would happily stay here again."
1917542,47423467,2015-09-18,5656675,Derek,"The place was spotless, charmingly decorated, and very centrally located. Lots of amazing shops and restaurants were within a couple blocks. Stuart is a pro at this, and everything you need is there. "
1917542,48322596,2015-09-25,21066515,Eric,"Stuart's place is in a great part of Portland. Easy walking access to a bunch of restaurants and bars and it was a quick drive into downtown. 

The unit was clean and warm and it was great having a private entrance. "
1917542,48880366,2015-09-29,31410953,Irving,"Stuart, was a great host with a wonderful accommodation. The Sun House was very clean, spacious for my girlfriend and I, and in the perfect friendly neighborhood. We were at easy reach of great Portland attractions, most within walking distances. Stuart took the time to provide great instructions on how to use mass transit from the airport to the door step of the Sun House.  Our arrival was smooth and struggle free.  We arrived to find a plate of fresh grapes as a welcoming gesture. Stuart even took the time in advance to ask what type of milk / creamer we preferred with our coffee and had it waiting for us in the fridge. A very helpful resource that Stuart provided was the abundant magazines and brochures of all the amazing places to visit in the Portland area. The highlight of this accommodation, however, was the extremely comfortable bed perfect for a good nights rest after a days worth of walking all over town! I highly recommend this accommodation and will hope to stay again on my next trip to Portland. "
1917542,49259677,2015-10-02,5885681,Cecelia,"Stuart was a terrific host. His descriptions and directions were super thorough making check-in a breeze. The Sun House was clean, cozy, and the location was perfect to explore Portland. I had a great time and would recommend the Sun House to everyone!"
1917542,49433330,2015-10-04,10642262,Laura,"Stuart's set-up, just as described, was perfect for our 3-day visit. It was easy to get to via public transportation and in a sweet little spot. 
He gave responsive and detailed information, and it couldn't have been any easier.  Great host!"
1917542,49856417,2015-10-06,26075622,Lauren,"Our stay was wonderful. Pictures and description very accurate, lots of space, comfortable bed, and lovely little touches around the place. Parking was easy and neighborhood was a great location for many places walking and driving distance. Would highly recommend!"

1917542,51706343,2015-10-24,40434597,Angeline,"This was my first time using airbnb so I didn't have many expectations. In all honesty, I was a little apprehensive. The Sun House was a great first experience for me. It was located in a quiet neighborhood. The Sun House was clean and neat. It looked exactly like the pictures. No surprises here. Stuart was a great host. He was really helpful when we needed him, but also kept his distance to give us our privacy. He was kind enough to ask us what type of milk we preferred with our coffee/tea so that we would have some ready in our mini fridge for when we arrived. It didn't even feel like we were living in someone else's home. It felt like our own place which is what I loved about the entire experience. You won't regret staying at The Sun House. Every time I come to Portland now, I will be staying at The Sun House. That is how much I loved this place. "
1917542,52098542,2015-10-26,34948290,Rachel,Our stay was perfect. Stuart's pictures and description were very accurate.  There was lots of space and the bed was super comfortable.  Stuart even left lots of information/magazines on things to do around the area which we really appreciated. Parking was easy and the neighborhood was a great location for many places walking and driving distance around Portland.  
1917542,52728966,2015-11-01,27374622,Mariangela,"The Sun House is just as described in the post. The one thing that I enjoyed the most is how clean it felt. The place is also centrally located, just about a 10-15 minute drive to downtown and a little over an hour to Mt. Hood. Stuart responded to my inquiries in a very timely manner which reassured me that everything was in place for my stay. Also, a couple of very nice homey touches made the experience excellent (i.e. fresh coffee, tea,  along with creamer and a couple of apples/oranges). "
1917542,53332766,2015-11-08,13643125,Nina,"Stuart was the perfect host. He initiated contacted before our arrival and was readily available by text if we had any questions during our stay.  The Sun House Suite is beautifully appointed, comfortable has high quality mattress and pillows... and most importantly (to us) it was very, very clean.  We loved the quiet neighborhood and its proximity to great restaurants, Whole Foods and TriMet.  

We definitely want to book the Sun House on our next trip to Portland.  We can't recommend it highly enough!"
1917542,54119603,2015-11-16,19282140,Maria Francisca,"This is a great place to stay at Portland. It is centrally located (20 minutes from downtown by bus), and it is in a nice neighborhood. The apartment gives you a lot of Independence to come and go as you please without disturbing the owner. It is very nicely decorated and it is very well equipped. For me the best part was the extremely soft and cushy queen size bed, which will guarantee many nights of restful sleep for the visitor. I would totally recommend this place to my friends to stay at while visiting PDX."
1917542,54597069,2015-11-22,2860803,Ekaterina,"Stuart's place is comfortable, clean and in a great location. There is a bus stop just a block away, big market in an easy walking distance and plenty of food options. The apartment is thoughtfully set, nicely decorated and you'll find a lot of maps, books and other useful information on the book shelf. Stuart was easy to reach, responding to all communications fast and was very patient with me when I was chasing phantom emails."
1917542,56216097,2015-12-10,50331137,Robin,"This property was in a great, central location with ample parking on the residential street. Stuart's instructions were detailed, making it very easy to find.
The place was clean, quiet and worked well for my mother and me. We both snore, but I slept comfortably and uninterrupted on the pull out sofa in the front room, and we were separated by two doors.
Stuart was responsive and friendly.
We'd recommend this place to our friends and would stay here again.

"
1917542,56634238,2015-12-15,48825203,Will,"My flight was delayed about 2 hours, so Stuart left me detailed instructions on how to find the home and pick up the keys.  Everything was setup according to the description.  The place was heated prior to my arrival - it was cold that night.  He also left me a small container of half and half.  The unit is exactly as described.  It's a small unit big enough for 2...maybe 3 people.  The home is located behind some homes and it's very quiet.  The home is beneath Stuart's home.  Bed was very comfortable.  I liked the house slippers, since part of the floor was cold.  He ground some coffee.  Unfortunately, I didn't use it.  There was also tea provided.  The neighborhood is almost like mine - a lot of character.  I felt safe even though the driveway to the home was dark.  Parking is ok.  First night, I had to park about a block away.  After that, right off the driveway."
1917542,57413784,2015-12-25,31886133,Padrig,"Stuart was very flexible with our sign in time and very understanding when I made the mistake of not thoroughly reading our itinerary, causing us to be locked out for the night (sorry Stuart!). The place itself is wonderful, very clean, and every question you have is answered by little notecards he leaves around the apartment. The location is great as well. Mississippi is a cool spot with plenty of shops and food around and downtown is about a 5 minute drive away. If I end up coming back to Portland this is the first place I'll check for availability."
1917542,58620165,2016-01-03,50088084,Heather,"This was our first time using Aribnb.  We rented the place for our wedding and for my future in-laws .  Stuart was very communicative and polite.  I should have asked more about the place before booking it as I thought it was a private suite off another house, not the downstairs of a condo.  The place was very clean and nice, again though it was my fault that I rented the downstairs of someone's house as opposed to a grandmother suite.  I thought the room would be sharing a wall, not the entire ceiling/floor.  We were forewarned that there would be a NYE party that would go until just after midnight, it went until past 2AM and the smell of home cooked Chinese food was a little overwhelming.  Again though, I do blame myself for not better researching the place, it was a little last minute.  Stuart was very gracious when my in-laws left one of the two sets of keys at our apartment on the other side of town, we realized hours before leaving for our honeymoon (same day as they checked out), on the same day that Portland's ice-apocalypse hit.  I tried to make it to his house to turn in the key but had to redirect in order to make out flight (which we barely caught).  My mother drove from the mountain a few days later to collect and mail the key to Stuart.  All in all, great location and very communicative host.  Thank you for housing my in laws on their first trip to Portland.  "
1917542,59133111,2016-01-07,49426161,Hannah,Stuart and the Sun House were great. The location was great for our needs. Easy walking distance to the conference center and great coffee on the way! It was very easy to find and we particularly liked the bird themed furnishings! If you are looking for a great place to stay in Portland this is a good option!
1917542,59427624,2016-01-10,7248910,Fabio,"Stuart and his family were great hosts! We did not have many chances to interact with him because of our tight schedule in Portland, but he was around and available if needed. The suite is nicely decorated and on the ground floor of his house, but it is practically separated, offering quiet and privacy. We did not have any trouble in finding parking within a block and most Portland neighborhoods are within 10 minutes drive. I definitely recommend it! "
1917542,59661959,2016-01-13,51681507,Mark,Stuart is very nice and friendly. It was a clean and cozy house. The neighborhood was very quiet. There were two bus stations close by so it was very convenient to go to other places. We had a wonderful time there.
1917542,60478797,2016-01-24,24705412,Erin,Stuart was great! He made sure that we had everything we needed. First time I had a host email me prior and ask if I drink coffee or tea and what I took in both. He had everything there. He also knocked on the door to make sure that we were ok and comfortable. Would stay here again. 
1917542,61836384,2016-02-08,27533137,Steven,"The Air BnB met expectations as per description. Just over the bridge from downtown Portland which was convenient for my trip. Communication from host was very good prior, during and after stay. "
1917542,62226540,2016-02-12,44290933,David,"Great place for single travelers and couples! The sun house was very clean and comfortable. Entry access was easy and parking was easy as well.  Very Close to cool/great restaurants on willians, very walkable. Go to Lincoln Restaurant for dinner/drinks and breakfast/brunch-Tasty&Sons!  Fast uber ride to downtown! Go to Bailey's Taproom for tasty local beers!"
1917542,62376815,2016-02-14,47028252,Rose,"Stuart and the Sun House were really great! Everything was perfectly in order and clean. I appreciated the communication and detailed directions prior to the trip and while we stayed. The room is on the bottom of their house but we have complete privacy. Awesome location too, just over the bridge which was an easy uber to downton/pearl district. Great walking distance from some awesome restaurants in the area (hello Pine State Biscuits!). I'd definitely recommend this place and would stay there again. "
1917542,62775491,2016-02-16,11494417,Kimberly,"It was a great place to stay, very central and easy to get to. Stuart was helpful and friendly. The bed was on the softer side so was perfect. The place is the cleanest I've ever stayed. There is a bit of noise periodically from a heater, water heater, or plumbing. It would have bothered me trying to sleep but I couldn't hear it with ear plugs.  I'd definitely stay here again!"
1917542,63189268,2016-02-21,11699433,Alexis,"Stuart was very welcoming and I felt very comfortable in the Sun House! I loved the self check-in because we drove in late from Seattle on our first night; this allowed us the privacy and flexibility to check-in and check-out at our own time. Everything was organized and clean and it was the perfect amount of space for a weekend trip for 2 people. 

The neighborhood was quiet and family-friendly and we didn't have trouble finding street parking. We also met some friendly cats throughout our stay. I would recommend the Sun House to family and friends."
1917542,63601905,2016-02-24,59415085,Daryn,"The Sun House in Portland is a true gem.  Stuart has done a lot to make this suite as inviting and quaint as anything you could imagine.  This is a very clean and attractive place to stay that has really nice, quality amenities such as a very modern bathroom with beautiful fixtures to a bed that is comfortable to lay on!  The suite even has a booklet for suggestions of good places to visit as well as pamphlets that speak of the Portland area.  We really loved this place... It is cozy, clean, affordable, and inviting.  The location also gives you close access to cool places like the Mississippi Avenue shopping and restaurants.  We found the Mississippi Avenue area for attractions to be our favorite in Portland.  We would highly recommend the Sun House!!!   Stuart provides a beautiful place to stay!!!  You will not be disappointed.  It provides a high quality experience you will enjoy!!!"
1917542,63907038,2016-02-28,55539026,Gloria,The Sun House was very comfortable and clean.  It was exactly as advertised.  Stuart was a good host.  Although we did not meet him he did check up on us to see if we had any needs.  We would definitely stay there again.
1917542,64878266,2016-03-08,59325409,Emma,"The Sun House is a wonderful, welcoming place to stay. I was a first-time Airbnb user, and Stuart made me feel so comfortable with the rental process and in his space. As a woman traveling alone, my first priority was safety, and I felt 100% at ease with everything about (EMAIL HIDDEN)munication was clear, and checking in was a breeze, even with my late arrival time. The Sun House is cozy, immaculately clean, and very convenient to downtown Portland. And I could have slept on that big, plush bed forever! "
1917542,65103749,2016-03-10,15689364,Stephanie,"The space:
The Sun House was private, cozy, and well-equipped for a first-time (or anytime) stay in Portland. It was easy to find, warm and welcoming. We especially loved the little instructional cards that 
Stuart left around the house. It felt like a hotel! The living area was perfect for winding down. Having a refrigerator and microwave was perfect! Stuart even took time prior to find out if we take anything special for coffee and dropped off some almond milk for us. The Sun House had everything we needed: a comfy bed, a Roku for some late night TV, a nice bathroom with sufficient toiletries, and a large closet space equipped with hangers, a dresser, and some ground space to lay out suitcases. 

The location:
Getting around was so easy. We didn't ride public transportation, but there was always an Uber/Lyft, or Car2Go nearby. The drive to downtown was a short 10 minutes. The neighborhood is quaint, quiet, and cute‚great for photos! 

I will definitely stay at The Sun House again and recommend it to anyone making a trip to Portland.

1917542,66717898,2016-03-24,1292620,Robin & Sim,"This was our second visit to Sun House, while visiting family in Portland. We appreciate the apartment's quiet off-street setting and convenient location. It's immaculately clean, modern, and furnished with high quality linens and amenities. Two thumbs up for Sun House!"
1917542,67556163,2016-03-30,4413334,Eddy,"Staying at the Sun House was a great experience. The place is very clean and has all the things we needed for a weekend stay. It really looks like the pictures. The location is great too, very close to shops and restaurants and a short drive to downtown. The noise from upstairs does carry into the suite but it stops well before bedtime so it was not disruptive.

Stuart was very fast to respond and pro-active with providing detailed directions to the location, check-in and check-out, and just generally making sure we had all the information we needed to make the experience easy and enjoyable. Thanks Stuart, you are definitely one of the best AirBnB hosts that I've stayed with!"
1917542,67939206,2016-04-01,19349094,Amanda,"The Sun House was a quaint and private suite that suited us perfectly! Stuart was there to greet us even though we got in later in the evening and was very helpful in providing information on local places to eat. The bed was very cozy and everything was provided for us (towels, extra pillows and sheets, tea, and plenty of guides). I would definitely recommend this place as the location is great for getting to the city as well as other districts. We hope to be able to stay here again the future and thanks for everything Stuart! :)"
1917542,68097183,2016-04-02,55802175,Natalie,"Stuart was very friendly and welcoming as he stopped by to check and make sure we had everything we needed. He provided us half and half for our coffee and a pack and play for the baby. The suite is beautiful, clean and modern. We loved the suite! Would definitely stay here again :) "
1917542,68748537,2016-04-06,52354152,Kayla,"We had a great time staying at the Sunhouse! Stuart is a great host and the space was just perfect. It was very homey and anything you could think you could need, Stuart had stocked there. I thought that having shampoo and conditioner, along with a first-aid kit were really nice things to provide for guests. The Sunhouse is also in the perfect location, allowing you to easily access all of the areas of Portland that you would like to explore. If we go back to Portland, we would definitely stay at the Sunhouse again! "
1917542,68916807,2016-04-07,3906593,Justin,"Stuart's private suite is an awesome place to stay! He was extremely welcoming the whole time and although I didn't have times that worked out to meet him personally, he was very friendly and available for any questions.  The suite itself was cleaned spotless and the bed was super comfortable.  This was one of the best Airbnbs that I have ever stayed in.  The location was really convenient as well. It was close to a lot of good food locations and the Nike Factory Store.  I loved every part of staying here and there was plenty of local recommendations in Stuart's guidebook. I 100% recommend this to other travelers!"
1917542,69250565,2016-04-10,49961847,Shyamal,"Great place if you are a tourist and don't spend a lot of time in the room. Also, coolest cat I've ever seen "
1917542,70098812,2016-04-16,53297916,Jessica,"This was our first Airbnb experience and Stuart made it great. The place was great and exactly as pictured. He made himself available throughout our stay, even when we had a very late check in! This was an awesome experience. Highly recommended it. "
1917542,70504276,2016-04-18,44608501,Kunal,"Thank you, Stuart, for making our stay in Portland so comfortable! 

Our experience at the quiet and conveniently-located Sun House was super great. I can totally see why Stuart has the ""Superhost"" badge -- we were so impressed with the impeccable neatness and cleanliness of the place, and the attention to detail. Self-checkin/checkout was smooth and easy too, with the instructions provided.

Highly recommended! We hope to be back whenever we visit Portland next."
1917542,70879519,2016-04-21,179944,TimAnthony,"There are simply not enough praises I can give Stuart & his perfectly lovely Sun Suite Studio!  Stuart was always quick & efficient in all communications.  And his place is just PERFECT.  It's the right size, tastefully decorated, and has all the amenities one would need (speedy wifi, smart HD TV with Netflix, Hulu, etc, a kitchen nook with everything u would need for preparing a simple meal...mini-fridge, microwave, cutlery & dishes, a SUPER comfy queen size bed, a pull out sofa, if u have more than 2 guests, a modern, clean & well stocked bathroom with thirsty, fluffy towels, a closet with a dresser, & there's even a few umbrellas in case it rains.  He has a plethora of guide books & info on things to do & see in Portland.  His place is so conveniently located to everything, & the neighborhood is clean, safe, & super friendly.  If you have travel plans that bring you to Portland, OR, then do yourself a HUGE favor and book a stay at Stuart's Sun House Studio Suite, you will be VERY glad you did!"
1917542,71382273,2016-04-25,4535351,Celia Gabel,"Stuart was very accommodating. We landed in PDX earlier than the check in time, but he allowed us to drop our bags off, explore, and come back for the check in time. We really appreciated that. Stuart made it possible for us to have our own space and privacy, which made us feel really comfortable in Portland. The neighborhood was quiet and friendly, even the neighborhood cats were engaging. Would highly recommend staying at The Sun House for an amazing Portland experience. The location is close enough to all the sights but far enough that you're not over stimulated with all there is to do.  "
1917542,71832152,2016-04-29,9217625,Hannah,"Our stay at The Sun House was wonderful. Th space is cozy and warm and fit the 3 of us perfectly. 
Stuart was very helpful and his recommendations were worth checking out:) "
1917542,72786260,2016-05-04,53621134,Tong,Stuart welcomed us even though we arrived to Portland late (10 p.m.).  The Sun House is very cute and clean.  We loved the comfortable bed and pillows!  This place has everything we needed during our stay.  It is less than 2 miles from downtown and is convenient to get on the highways(URL HIDDEN)
1917542,73478672,2016-05-08,32497563,Anna,"This air bnb was absolutely perfect. Lots of space, great location, nice and cool as its in a basement and the weather during our stay was very very warm! It's about a 20-30 minute walk into downtown but that was great for me as I love walking! "
1917542,74119067,2016-05-13,11601826,Chris,"Stuart provided an amazing suite that was extremely welcoming. I would definitely recommend it to anyone staying in the area. It had more amenities then we could even ask for and Stuart was extremely friendly, but allowed us to have all the privacy we needed. Fantastic time and stay."
1917542,74912624,2016-05-17,40309669,Kelsey,"This was my first AirB&B experience and it was absolutely fantastic!! Stuart gave very thorough directions and check in instructions, greeted us and gave us ideas on places to eat and drink. He was very responsive to our questions during our stay, and gave us the space we needed to enjoy our trip. "
1917542,75891820,2016-05-23,27601144,Joe,Stuart was very helpful and friendly.  He kept in touch leading up to our stay and even made a change to his plans to accommodate our departure date.  Great host and great place to stay.
1917542,76360046,2016-05-26,21785981,Cassandra,Beautiful private suite stocked with everything I needed for my two day trip. I briefly met Stuart while leaving the suite in the morning. Stuart was very responsive and accommodating. I highly recommend the sun house to other travelers!
1917542,77528874,2016-06-01,5960388,Liam,Would definitely stay again. Excellent location and apartment and Stuart is kind and accommodating.
1917542,81154001,2016-06-21,21270598,Lydia,"The Sun House is fantastic!!  In a great neighborhood with easy access to most parts of the city, but tucked away a little so it seems a lot more private than being right on the street.  Stuart has turned a pretty average basement into a very comfortable, usable space, equipped with all the amenities that you need for a short to medium length visit.  Bed is extremely comfortable, wifi is fast, overall a perfect perfect place to call home base in the city.  Thank you Stuart!!"
1917542,81477552,2016-06-23,12500895,Susan,"Stuart was very welcoming and a pleasure to work with.  His suite had everything we needed, including coffee, tea, very cozy bed, and a separate area and table for working.  The place was very clean and all instructions were clear and thorough.  We were able to walk to many restaurants and a grocery store from his suite;  and Stuart  even has a binder with directions to all of them."
1917542,82770550,2016-06-29,68544315,Ryan,"The Sun House was fantastic. This was my first experience with Airbnb. 

The Sun House is tucked away from the street, which kept noise down. The location in general is as close to perfect as I can imagine. I got around on my bike, and it took no more that 20 minutes to get downtown from the Sun House. The neighborhood itself is also a beautiful one. I really appreciated getting to see both the downtown areas with all the hubbub as well as the residential areas around it. There are so many great places to eat well within walking distance. 

The Sun House itself was a great home base for my explorations. Stuart has provided a lot of Portland guidebooks that helped me find places to visit. And after a day of walking and biking, it was nice to come back to a comfy bed and Netflix to relax. I especially appreciated the iron and ironing board, as many of my clothes were very wrinkled from being in my bags. 

Stuart is obviously a very experienced host, as I couldn't think of anything more he could have provided. I'm looking forward to my next stay."
1917542,82985374,2016-06-30,12710974,Britney,"We loved staying at the Sunhouse suite! It was very clean and felt hotel like, but ""homey!"" Stuart was responsive and offered suggestions on hiking. The neighborhood is really cool-- especially up on Williams, which is walking distance from the suite and has restaurants and bars! Public transportation is easy to get to from the suite to travel into the city. We really enjoyed our time in Portland and in Stuart's Sunhouse Suite. Thank you! "
10548243,60377108,2016-01-22,55613064,Jon,"I had to take a last-minute trip to Portland and was lucky enough to find this space. The White Spider team immediately responded to my message, which was a major stress reliever, and made themselves available for any questions I had. Chantel, the manager, was super sweet and sent clear check-in instructions and house rules, which was great since I was coming in so late. As for the space: the photos don‚t do it justice. It‚s a house that‚s set back from the VERY private dead-end street and surrounded by trees. I didn‚t cook, but the kitchen has everything you would need to make a home-cooked meal, and there was tea and coffee left for me for the morning. The bed was comfy with tons of pillows and there were three Pendleton blankets in the house! As said in the ad, there is no television here, but the WiFi was fast and I was able to watch a movie on my laptop with no issues. All in all this was a perfect experience, and I will definitely make sure to stay here again on return trips to Portland! "
10548243,62033314,2016-02-10,44611555,Filippo,"i felt super welcomed as the place was so convenient to get over a little sickness, the green foliage  on the outside helped me clear my lungs and the colors and coziness of the place itself let me heal. i was happy to be there as it was close to everything i wanted and needed, and the privacy was something i cherished. thank you again, it was super nice to be there, cannot wait to go back again."
10548243,62226928,2016-02-12,44611555,Filippo,"enjoyed the neighborhood and the amenities. super cozy and cannot wait to go back again, what a great experience. "
10548243,62604797,2016-02-15,30650554,Erin,"This was a beautiful, quiet, restful retreat at a time when we really needed it. How peaceful to lie in the super comfy bed while listening to the rain pound on the windows. The furniture and decor was clearly so thoughtfully chosen and if you like a full kitchen when you travel, you will love this place. Thanks for the great coffee and tea, too.
"
10548243,66222407,2016-03-20,60662546,Erica,"The house was filled with everything I would need to feel comfortable such as shampoo in the bathroom and all the utensils I needed to cook meals in the kitchen. It was a very warm and inviting space and I instantly felt like I was home. The owner of the property was very kind and very helpful. Any questions about my stay were answered right away. I would love to stay here again next time I am in Portland.

"
10548243,66733096,2016-03-24,1652957,Bill,Sanctuary was spot on... Quiet and cozy tucked into a charming location close to city center.  Very clean and comfortable.  Privacy was a plus.
10548243,67953777,2016-04-01,61582629,Joey,"Great space! The wife and I loved our stay in this awesome cozy spot just outside the craziness of the city.  Nice kitchen, comfy bed, great spot overall. Really quiet area. "
10548243,69804935,2016-04-13,9523820,Kat & Eliza,"Impressed with how fully equipped the kitchen is! The host was very responsive and the spot is really sweet, nestled in the woods. Woods Memorial Natural Area is nearby and great for hiking. If you are sensitive to low hums, this place may not be for you. "
10548243,74950489,2016-05-17,18352696,Lyn,"What a wonderful place to stay!  The place was exactly as described, nestled in the woods of Multnomah Village in Portland.  The space was cozy and warm with a very relaxing vibe.  The owner, Virgil, was wonderful.  He was available if we had issues and introduced himself when we arrived, but otherwise let us do our thing.  While the house is next to the owner's property, it's on a separate lot with a separate driveway so we didn't feel like we were in someone's backyard.  Instead it felt like a secret hideout in the woods.  We loved this spot and hope to return again someday!  "
10548243,77360843,2016-05-31,64026124,Torri,"This is a comfy cottage! We will be happy to return when we come to visit our daughter again! 
We love Portland! Location is tranquil. And easy to get to downtown. Love sitting outside on the patio too.
There were a couple hiccups when we arrived - the cottage had not been cleaned for us, which was addressed as soon as we called. Make sure you understand how the lock works. It is easy peasy, but instructions are really not that clear at first. 
Thank you for making our first Airbnb experience a great one! 
See you again soon Portland!"
10548243,79783276,2016-06-14,31937367,LuAnn,This studio style home was wonderful for my parents whom are both in their late 70's.  The only thing that would have made it better was the shower which was very accessible for mobility challenged people however the shower floor was too slippery for my mother to feel safe standing in. We had a lovely time celebrating my fathers birthday and my son's graduation from PSU. Thank you for being prompt in answering my texts Chantel :)
10548243,80917536,2016-06-20,77555993,Niels,"Great stay! Everything was as good as described. Easy access to the sites of Portland, but tucked away in the woods. Would definitely do it again."
10548243,81986894,2016-06-26,11918558,Rachel,The host was very responsive to any questions I had prior and during the trip. The location of the house was perfect for the must needed relaxing vacation I was hoping. The house itself was very clean and cozy. This Airbnb was definitely a major contributor to what made me want to visit Portland again. 
11101624,63308038,2016-02-21,19593563,Rylei,"Amanda is super nice. She gave me extra blankets and a space heater the night I got in because It was raining and a little extra cold that night. Her bathrooms are very clean and smell great also. 
"
11101624,63313298,2016-02-21,3949275,Dean,Amanda provided very clear instructions on check in and everything was exactly as described.  The bed was super comfortable and I slept really well.  One really great thing about being 'on the bus' is that you can come and go at odd hours without disturbing your host yet it's not as expensive as most rentals that provide that level of privacy (bathroom is not private).
11101624,64027190,2016-02-28,58919188,Viviana,"Staying at the Bohemian bus was definitely and interesting experience.  Amanda was really nice and approachable, she showed me how to access the house, kitchen, bathroom, etc.  The place is a bit far away from downtown Portland so that's something to consider.  The night I stayed happened to be very cold so if you get cold easily that's something else to think about!  A heater and many blankets were provided :).  Either way Amanda was a great host and the bus itself was lovely, overall a fun experience.  "
11101624,64748424,2016-03-07,55714975,Amit,Place was great as advertised and the host was super friendly. Nice spot to get away for the night 
11101624,65417177,2016-03-13,58648315,Jennifer,"This is an absolutely wonderful place to stay. Not only is Amanda incredibly friendly and accommodating, but the bus is very cool. And seriously, that bed is really comfy! I had plenty of extra blankets and a space heater for the cooler nights. Because it's not a part of the house, I felt I had so much privacy, which I really liked. But when I did need access to anything - bathroom, kitchen - it was only a few steps away and I always felt very welcomed. The house is great - bright, clean, and comfortable.

The MAX green line stop is less than a ten minute walk from the house, so getting downtown is easy with or without driving.

I had a blast! And I couldn't have asked for a better host or a more charming set up."
11101624,65482107,2016-03-14,23318582,Callie,"The bus was lovely. Very cozy and the blankets were so warm and soft! It was a great way to escape from the rain. Amanda was kind and I would definitely stay here again. 

Thanks for the hospitality "
11101624,66275012,2016-03-20,31481882,Brittany,"Rad! She is very sweet and accommodating and made the bathroom and shower accessible. The bed is really comfortable and warm, it does get cold at night being that it's Portland, but the space heaters do more than enough. It's a sweet little set up and I'd definitely stay there again. Two thumbs up!"
11101624,68213736,2016-04-03,64059274,Caleb,The bus was a great spot to spend time in Portland. It is close to a bus stop and the light rail. The bed was nice enough to keep warm. Amanda was a great and kind host.
11101624,68273196,2016-04-03,59968246,JodyLynn,"This was such a perfect setup for a brief visit to Portland - I had my dog with me and Amanda was so flexible and lovely and welcoming! The neighborhood is quiet and felt very safe, and the bus was very cute, cozy, and secure. 

I definitely plan on trying to stay here again when I come through Portland in the future! "
11101624,68502285,2016-04-05,63080895,Kelly,"Amanda is wonderful host! She was very generous with her home and made me feel very comfortable. The bus was perfect. Extra blankets and space heaters were available if it got too cold, and the bed was great! I also enjoyed being so close to the light rail, which can get you to downtown or to/from the airport. (It was only a little more than a block away). Highly recommend. "
11101624,69932330,2016-04-14,17305281,Maricela,Amazing bus! Amanda was sweet helped me with my bags and showed me around. The heater made me feel soo comfy that I overslept. I woke up at 6 am only to see the entire bus filled with a blue aura. Wow. Cool vibes. Zero her cat is a sweetie. I would love to come back here the next time I visit :) 
11101624,70385878,2016-04-17,67349671,Gerda,Amanda was very nice and the bus very cozy. 
11101624,72558584,2016-05-03,68764595,Thomas,"The stay at the bus was Awesome!! If your into the whole simple living and staying thing this place is rad. Warm sleep area, friendly host, and just very laid back and nice. "
11101624,72910201,2016-05-05,60555872,Megan,This was a great little place to spend the night! Unique and cozy. Perfect access to everything I needed. I was in and out but hosts seemed very kind! 
11101624,73909522,2016-05-11,62861008,Kiley,"Amanda was incredibly warm and welcoming and made my stay so comfortable. Her rundown of what to use/where things were/how to get around was clear, concise and helpful. The bus is adorable... I felt like I was living inside the Instagram Nashville filter lol. Pretty dream-like! Amanda answered all my questions, made me a hand-drawn map to get around, and drove me 20 minutes to meet my next ride the morning of my departure. The hospitality was in full effect. 100% would go back. Also, Zero the cat is a supermodel and I love him. "
11101624,74369332,2016-05-15,69579056,Rick,"Loved the bus!  The bed was so comfortable.  I had easy access to the kitchen and bathroom in the house.  Amanda and her roommate were really cool too.  So much more personal an experience than a hotel.  We sat around and drank coffee and had great discussions in the morning.  There wasn't an air conditioner which concerned me when I first got there because the next day was supposed to get up to 90.  But even without an air conditioner the bus was totally comfortable at night.  I slightly opened a few windows and it was plenty cool that night.  Portland is not like Nashville where I'm from.  You'd melt in 90 degree weather in Nashville without AC, but it ended up not being a problem at all.  I slept really well both nights I was there.  The bus is centrally located as well.  I was 15 minutes from everything.  If, and when I visit Portland again, I'll definitely check to see if the bus is available!  I mean I got to post on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) that I was literally living in a van down by the river!  Thanks Amanda!"
11101624,75372882,2016-05-21,48262095,Rachel,Amanda was wonderful! It's located in a nice and quite neighborhood. The description was 100% accurate and the max and bus line are within walking distance. No need to rent a car. Highly recommended  to anyone looking for a home away from home. ;-)
11101624,75758837,2016-05-22,72371887,Joe,We had an awesome experience. Amanda was super easy to coordinate with and everything was like she said. The bus is super cozy and was just what we needed for our short stay in Portland. It was close to down town and we felt very welcomed. If we ever do another short trip like this to Portland we will stay here again.
11101624,76137444,2016-05-25,61539805,Jessica,I absolutely loved staying at the bus - it felt like a sanctuary for the spirit! This was the perfect way to experience Portland! Amanda was incredibly friendly and her home was extrmely welcoming & comforting. The location is  ideal for all major transit routes and easy to get to and from the city. I would highly recommend the bus to anyone looking for a peaceful Portland experience !!!!
11101624,76661422,2016-05-28,41366479,Kate,Unique experience! If you're looking for something different this is it. Super cute bus with very comfortable bed. Lots of blankets and a heater in case it gets cold. Would stay here again!
11101624,77744028,2016-06-03,8029914,Brittany,Amanda was a great host. Super accommodating at check-in. For the rest of the stay I had privacy and quiet in my bus retreat.
11101624,79818478,2016-06-14,9646099,Julienne,"Amanda was there to greet me when I got there, and graciously let me drop my bags off at her house before check in time so I could continue on the day trip I had planned. She was so nice to talk to, as well as her roommate and their pets. The bus was extremely comfortable. I thought it would be slightly annoying with the bathroom being in the house, but it was perfect. I would stay here just as quickly as staying in any other type of Airbnb accommodation. I didn't get to explore the neighborhood much, but it seemed very sweet and residential."
11101624,79941865,2016-06-15,77369696,Angela,Amanda was super accommodating even though I was extremely last minute! She was kind and did not seem to be bothered by my last minute arrival/booking at all. The space was just as described and very cute. I would definitely stay here again!
11101624,80250094,2016-06-17,30901607,Kira,Amanda was very nice and they bus was comfy! If you want to stay with more than one person be aware that it costs extra - I missed this in the description. Overall a great stay though!
11101624,81774081,2016-06-25,50918203,Molly,"It's going to e hard to write this because my stay was so amazing, I don't even know where to start!!  First of all, everything was clean and safe and just as expected from the posting.  Amanda and her house mates (and their pets!) were so amazing and friendly and helpful and fun!!!  I wish I could live on the bus! Highly recommended :). "
11101624,82772707,2016-06-29,37002557,Drew,"If I'm ever in Portland again, I definitely will be staying in the bus again! Amanda and her roommates are super friendly and staying in the bus really added to the overall experience of being in such a cool city."
13437401,82950740,2016-06-30,30885248,Kyle,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
10451659,65248009,2016-03-12,2657513,Rakesh,"This apartment is extremely spacious and clean. You can't beat this location; quick walk across the pedestrian bridge to the Pearl District (where there are countless great restaurants and bars). Bedroom has a nice view of Portland, as the condo is right on the riverfront. Kristi was very helpful and ensured we had everything we could have needed on our trip. Convenient parking and a small store around the corner. Will definitely be looking to stay here again next time we are in Portland."
10451659,67186255,2016-03-27,58081252,John,Place was very nice and pretty much in the middle of all the good experiences in the city. Would go back again for sure!
10451659,68651392,2016-04-06,18122552,Jarryd,"Kristi was very responsive and easy to communicate with. I was traveling into Portland and she was great at accommodating my travel schedule. Additionally, the apartment was a beautiful space and an even better location -- I'd definitely recommend a stay here!"
10451659,68745983,2016-04-06,8873575,Carl,The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
10451659,69034786,2016-04-08,1782105,James,Check-in and check-put was very easy. The place was as described and actually exceeded my expectations when I checked out the river in the morning.
10451659,69489342,2016-04-11,30109223,Devon,"The apartment itself was lovely, although the location on the map made it look a little more walkable than it actually was, the train tracks are in the way. Very clean and tidy, the neighborhood was very peaceful and enjoyable. I did feel a little misled by the posting though, this is definitely a 100% of the time Airbnb kind of property, not somewhere Kristi may or may not stay when traveling between Portland and SF. There were also some helpful instructions left in the unit, but they were written by a man named Ed. Who is he...?"
10451659,69796932,2016-04-13,48672665,Samantha,This was exactly as advertised.  Kristi communicated well. The space was clean and comfortable.  The instructions for the house were very clear and easy.  The neighborhood was just fine and was very close to transportation hubs for public transport or you could just walk downtown.  I would definitely stay here again when next we visit Portland. 
10451659,73000215,2016-05-06,44468832,Denise,"Stayed here three nights.  The condo is very spacious and comfortable.  The location is great; just a short walk to old town and/or the trains.  A 32 minute MAX ride from the airport ($2.50). This is a ground floor condo, but the upstairs occupants were not too heavy-footed.  Also the freight trains run pretty frequently. You won't really notice them with the bedroom window closed, but if you sleep with the window open the train whistles might wake you.  There is a river view from the bedroom window.   I should be clear that the windows in this place are heavy and there is little to no noise from the outside when they are closed.  There is central climate control in his unit.  I would definitely stay again.  Very clean and tidy.  "
10451659,73398602,2016-05-08,675171,Matt,"Kristi cancelled our reservation the day we were supposed to arrive, because she had double-booked with another service. She found us another place to stay at, and refunded us the difference in cost, but it was a less desirable location and we were in a rush to find something at the very last minute."
10451659,76447179,2016-05-27,38870996,Dee,Kristi was a great host. Very comfy place. I give her 5 stars. 
10451659,78559254,2016-06-07,35402444,Catherine,"Originally when I made my booking I thought I was reserving a different place, a unit with a view overlooking the river. It was a little confusing when I arrived and found it was a place where I had stayed previously under a different owner's name (Ed). This is a ground floor unit without a view. It had been upgraded with hardwood floors which look nice. The location is great, and there are several helpful menus posted on the wall for suggested area restaurants, which I really appreciated. I enjoyed the Peruvian restaurant Andina. The bed is comfortable and I slept well. Thank you for a nice stay."
10451659,79802645,2016-06-14,5097219,Erik,Great stay. Just as advertised. Clean and no hassles. Thanks!!
10451659,80452183,2016-06-18,37952198,Trevor,"Kristi's place was absolutely perfect. Everything was perfectly detailed in terms of instructions, the place was clean. Above and beyond by airbnb standards, with a perfect location. "
10451659,80791475,2016-06-19,18394713,Olivia,"Kristis spot was identical to the photos and the description. It was surprisingly larger than anticipated and very cozy. 

The kitchen area is a good size for cooking (although we didn't) and there is a cute dining table. The place was decorated well and is basically in downtown/the Pearl area. 

Rusty Nail (a bar) is right across the street. I like that she had an electronic lock, so check-in/out was a breeze. 

Plus the bed was SUPER comfy. Must be a Tempurpedic.

We would definitely stay again! "
10451659,82014374,2016-06-26,59061002,Sean,"Great space, comfortable bed. Easy access to Pearl District and downtown. Would stay again!"
10451659,82682149,2016-06-28,58394536,Gretchen,Great location! It was fairly easy to get to places throughout the city that we wanted to visit.  Condo was clean and spacious.  We also enjoyed use of the pool and hot tub. I would stay here again and recommend to someone coming to the Portland area. 
6106997,32408628,2015-05-17,30883752,Jacob,"Great house. Great location. Awesome hosts. 
Look no further, this is the place you should get. It's 10mins from everything in Portland. The hosts are very accommodating. Extremely responsive to all of my questions. I would definitely come back. "
6106997,33034415,2015-05-24,3977984,Katherine,"My stay at the guest house was wonderful. Even though I didn't have a chance to meet the hosts, the way they prepared the room for me was so welcoming! Everything was set up for my arrival in advance, and they were kind enough to accommodate my early check-in so I had more time to explore sans luggage. 

The location was within walking distance of the light rail from the airport, as well as bus stations. I also went to nearby Nicholas restaurant at the hosts' suggestion, and it was delicious. St. Simon coffee is just down the street, perfect to get the morning going.

There was plenty of space in the shared fridge, and I never had to wait to use the shared bathroom. Good shower water pressure. I made use of the bike shed in back to store my rental, conveniently included with the room.

From the moment of arrival to the time I walked out the door, everything was better than I could have expected--as much convenience as a hotel, but with a feeling more like home. Thank you for making my Portland visit so lovely!"
6106997,34830329,2015-06-12,10917480,Melissa,"I was traveling to Portland for work and this property was exactly what I was looking for. My own space, welcoming and down to earth, homey but still hotel type vibe. I enjoyed my stay and would recommend to future renters. "
6106997,34923381,2015-06-13,7863286,Dana,A friendly host and a very nice room. The house is very well set up for guests and they answered my texts within minutes. 
6106997,35254856,2015-06-16,11314527,Alessandra,"The listing description was very accurate. The house is in a very convenient neighborhood: close to coffee shops (starbucks, peets,caffe d'arte..), groceries shops  and  bars/restaurant. It is very well connected with downtown. The place itself is quite comfortable and  has all the amenities that one might need.  "
6106997,35888115,2015-06-22,36014213,Renee,"We were so glad we chose to stay here. Awesome location with plenty to do, places to eat along the street- safe too. The house was always clean and tidy and felt like a home for the four nights we stayed. Sharon is amazing. Very relaxed, easy stay here. We'd 100% stay here again if/when we return!"
6106997,36399567,2015-06-28,33164092,Curtis,"My partner and I enjoyed a comfortable 4 night stay. We selected the location due to it's proximity to the Oregon Convention Center, an easy walk or bike ride from our AirBnB room.
Our room was super clean and tidy, as was the rest of the house. While I only used the kitchen for morning coffee and light b'fast, it was fully equipped and we could have prepared more meals. Grocery stores were close by, as were many coffee shops, pubs, and eateries.
Bicycle parking was secure in an dedicated locked shed. It was an unusually hot week in Portland, and we were grateful that the house had A/C.
The hostess Sharon was delightful. We shared nice conversations over b'fast, and she was helpful in getting us oriented to the house. sWe'd definitely stay here again if our travels brought us back to NE Portland."
6106997,37025543,2015-07-03,122623,Alvin,"Host was welcoming with quick response. Room was good enough for what I wanted and the inn itself had good amenities (fridge, microwave, washing machine). Location was good with public transport to most places within good distance. "
6106997,37210257,2015-07-05,4592362,Julie,"Sharon was so sweet! She made sure to make all welcome. The house was very clean and super easy to show up after check-in time. The room was great/spacious and air conditioned! Overall, a great experience."
6106997,37713031,2015-07-09,36349779,Christoph Benedikt,Nice and clean room in a lively neighborhood. Sharon was a great host and I really enjoyed my stay
6106997,38805626,2015-07-18,117003,Robert,"I've had many wonderful stays on Airbnb, and staying at Tiger and Peacock's was another incredible and enjoyable experience. The booking process with them is the most professional and efficient experience I've ever had on Airbnb. Also, the accommodations were superb, and we loved our room, the bed and the location of their Airbnb. Next time I am in Portland, Tiger and Peacock's will be the place where I will to stay. Thank you for the wonderful visit and experience. "
6106997,39303313,2015-07-22,36315636,Robert,"Room and house was everything as described. No surprises. Clean room and house had nice amenities. Nice area with adequate of eating, drinking, shopping options all within walking distance. Nice local wine store close buy was super knowledgable and helpful. I shipped home 6 bottles of nice Oregon Pinot Noir"
6106997,39562239,2015-07-24,25955398,Stephanie,"A warm reception by Sharon, helpful letting me borrow platter and knife from kitchen for a morning meeting I was hosting. Comfortable bed and schedule option for shower. I wished I had my earplugs, road noise was continuous as house is on major roadway. Parking easy enough to find. No surprises just as described. Thanks"
6106997,39804855,2015-07-26,14246636,Michael,The location is a great for easy access to downtown (bus line is right across the street).  The keycodes for the front door and room make it super convenient for arriving late at night or when the host is not around.  No complaints! 
6106997,40186608,2015-07-28,39554927,Patrick,"We had a great time, the room was clean, bathrooms well maintained and stocked with the essentials. Hosts we're great as well as the late night conversations. Would stay again! Everyone was overall very friendly, and we especially appreciated not needing a key as the house was equipped with keypads. "
6106997,44313348,2015-08-25,17924856,Tim,"Sharon, the house mom, was super sweet!  We had many delightful conversations, she always made sure I had fresh towels and sheets, and I felt very welcome.  The room itself was cool and comfortable (the A/C and fans helped tremendously during the hot days).  I even got to use the full kitchen facilities, just had to be conscientious and clean up after myself.  The area itself is great, for being close to great bars and restaurants I never heard loud noises at night.  I would LOVE to stay here again next time I'm in Portland!"
6106997,44614343,2015-08-27,42323928,Evan,"Great location, very low maintenance place. Easy to come and go as you please. Seemed clean and well maintained. People were extremely nice and helpful. Plenty of food and drinks in the neighborhood. If you are a light sleeper, you might have some trouble with the creaking of the house and thin walls, and I would imagine things get rowdy when it's a full house. I used earplugs and slept like a baby. "
6106997,44979270,2015-08-30,11933760,Sara,"Tiger and Peacock have made quite an adorable retreat home! I felt comfortable and content my entire time in Portland. The neighborhood was extremely accessible and had numerous awesome bars/restaurants for exploring! Added bonus, parking on the side streets was a non-issue. I truly never wanted to leave! Can't wait to make a return trip!!"
6106997,45537348,2015-09-03,42876150,Rebecca,"The house was easy to find & in a nice, walkable neighborhood. The room was clean & the shower was good, too. The ladies living at the house were friendly.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone passing through Portland. It was very close to shopping, food & the train."
6106997,46047957,2015-09-07,12336731,Maribel,O
6106997,46679789,2015-09-12,29927503,Andrew,Possibly the easiest stay I've had at someone else's place. The code locks for both the front door and my room mean I was able to just walk in like it was my home. Location was great. Room was clean. Would definitely stay here again.
6106997,47095535,2015-09-15,42928280,Roni,"I stayed at the Broadway location. Sharon, the house mom, was great. She explained how to use various things in the house very nicely. She also made some buttered toast for me when I arrived and treated me to some of her tasty homemade Kombucha tea. The location was also perfect. It is close to many good restaurants, Lloyd Center mall, salons and boutique shops. I'd recommend this place to my friends anytime."
6106997,48194966,2015-09-24,41420363,Marianne,"Needed a location with easy public transit to OHSU and this home fit the bill perfectly.  Only a 3 block walk to the number 8 bus which ran frequently and dropped me off right in front of the hospital.  The N.E. Broadway location was charming with any number of food and shopping options. We especially enjoyed the Cadillac Cafe.  Beds were cozy, and kitchen option convenient. We had 3 rooms for our family members and everyone seemed delighted with the choice."
6106997,49560139,2015-10-04,2921241,Kelly,"The check-in process was very smooth and Sharon the house mom was proactive with facilitating it. My room was large, well appointed, and quiet, and part of a well-run guesthouse with a number of other rooms and groups of guests. While there were more people in the property overall than I expected, the hosts clear instructions electronically and throughout the home helped make the experience seamless and feel thoughtful."
6106997,50217781,2015-10-10,44973300,J,"This place is a nice place to stay, walking distance to shops and restaurants, about 10 min walk from Lloyd center, also MAX (the light rail) station. You can easily arrive from airport and get to most places in town by MAX or buses. Room is exactly as the photos, Sharon, the house mum is a very nice lady, had really nice conversations with her, she did make me feel like home. Will definitely stay again."
6106997,51064467,2015-10-17,19978460,Brian,Very warm and welcoming experience. The house is right on a main road which makes it easy getting in and out!
6106997,52668415,2015-10-31,3417186,Celeste,"I never met a soul, but this was just the right place to land for an evening. Located near an independent bookstore, a bakery, several restaurants and shops, the neighborhood provided entertainment and yet the room was quiet enough for sleep. The keepers are well-organized and communicated efficiently via text message. The home is clean, the room I stayed in spacious and furnished with a table and chairs in addition to a comfortable bed."
6106997,53401069,2015-11-08,3485745,Angeline,"What a great place to stay! Sharon was warm and welcoming. My room was clean, inviting and exactly as they described it. The bed was soooo comfortable. It was difficult to get up in the morning and leave it behind.

The location was convenient -- near many coffee shops, restaurants, and shops. You'll have to drive down a block or two for parking but nothing too inconvenient.

Thanks for a great stay! I hope to be back again.

6106997,55088224,2015-11-27,49576810,Haley,This was such a home away from home for my trip to Portland. I would recommend this cozy house to any traveler passing through for a short or long trip!
6106997,55535697,2015-12-01,148687,Arjun,"I had a great experience staying at Tiger & Peacock's place on NE Broadway. The house is a well-kept, charming old place with large rooms. The bed was large and comfortable and the bathrooms were clean. The location has stores, restaurants and cafes nearby and feels pretty safe. The hosts were very prompt in responding to queries which makes it so much nicer. I had several pleasant conversations with Sharon though I didn't meet Sharmil and Ian who live elsewhere. This was a very positive experience for me and I would recommended it to anyone. Thanks for a great stay!!"

6106997,59338991,2016-01-09,48611300,Cody,"The place was perfect. Nice location, very clean. Mt. Hood was very spacious and perfect for two. Sharon was very helpful and warming, even helped turn our king bed into two twins. Great restaurants nearby, i suggest black water bar. Nice walk to moda for blazers game. Right off the exit of the highway. And the hosts communicate very well. Would recommend, has a good suburb feel to the area just being a five minute drive to downtown."
6106997,59429726,2016-01-10,15053075,Samir,"This place was awesome.  Nice for the price and right on the strip.  parking was not hard to find, just one block over for me.  All in all this place was clean, secure, and well kept.  The price can't be argued for how nice it is.  Thanks again."
6106997,59594995,2016-01-12,52344655,Ben,"Everything was excellent! Tiger & Peacock's NE guest house is professionally run, with everything set up in advance. It's in a great location near transit, the room was spacious, the door codes were easy to use, and there was even space to use the kitchen if needed. There are also plenty of bathrooms and two different wifi networks, to ensure everyone's needs are met even if the house is full. And Sharon, the house mom for the NE location, was very nice and friendly."

They give you full use of the kitchen and provide many amenities such as towels, blow dryer , fridge space. I felt right at home. Organized and helpful host . I appreciated the individual combo lock on my room. I  would definitely recommend. Only caveat, if you are a light sleeper the rooms on the ground floor may be too loud as its on a Main Street. "
6106997,61592717,2016-02-06,713497,Roberta,"I enjoyed my stay at Tiger & Peacock. Sharon, the House Mom, was very prompt with responding to communications and was very kind and accommodating. I enjoyed my room which had a comfy bed in an older home full of Portland charm. There was a cozy kitchen where I fixed myself a cup of tea before retiring to bed. The location is very convenient and easy to find. I would love to stay here again when I come to Portland."

Portland love sooooo much!!!"

Access to my accommodation was super easy (and secure), and communications with the on-site host were top notch. I had access to the kitchen at all hours and made most of my meals; the kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need to cook. There are also many, many excellent restaurants within a few blocks, some of which are only steps away and most will deliver. The house is quiet and private and the wifi high speed and uncluttered. Laundry access was available as well, which I took advantage of. Tiger and Peacock (and Sharon) are excellent Airbnb hosts!"
6106997,69679578,2016-04-12,53753361,Rebecca,"Excellent communication. Very nice to deal with. Unfortunately I didn't get the chance to stay. Circumstances prevented me from getting there, but no fault of the host. They are super nice to deal with. If I come back to the area I will request again. :)"

Everything was clean, organized and well run. More like a professional B&B or hostel than someone's house. Keypad locks make coming and going a breeze. A very cool building, tons of walkable eat/drink options."
6106997,70304502,2016-04-17,18698455,Rachael,Great house and locarion. Very easy systen. Would stay here again !
6106997,72646018,2016-05-04,67045219,Jeremy,"Didn't really interact with hosts, but my travel companion got helpful suggestions on places to visit. We got our privacy and everything was clean. No complaints."
6106997,73340373,2016-05-08,17924856,Tim,"This is my second time staying at this great house, and once again, I can't recommend it enough.  Somehow a house so closed to decent bars stays quiet at night!  I made new friends there, had a wonderful time as always talking food with the house mom... When friends come to visit, this place will be my top recommendation :)"
6106997,74361991,2016-05-15,25330038,Gabriel,The house was in a great location and had easy access to everything. The room was clean and hosts were super considerate. It was an amazing stay!
6106997,74984676,2016-05-18,31477723,Jenny,Cute place in a great location. Nice quiet place to get some zzzs
6106997,75138927,2016-05-19,69888201,Suchi,"Amazing room, excellent host!"
6106997,75384736,2016-05-21,59272969,Jason,"Tiger and Peacock's ""Mt. Hood"" Room was exactly as advertised.  
The room was very comfortable and they were very accomodating with my last minute arrangements.  If I was looking for another short term stay I would definitely stay here again.  

Some nice restaurants and fun bars in walking distance both directions on Broadway, and you can easily Uber anywhere in the area for a short cheap fare.  "
6106997,77373567,2016-05-31,61160956,Randy,"The house is well maintained and has a lot of character.  The other guests were polite and caused no problems at all.  Very easy setup for starting and ending our stay.  The parking in back was fine.  Information said don't park next to the no parking signs, but I did not see any no parking signs.
Thanks for a nice experience.
Randy  "
6106997,78063087,2016-06-05,55409740,Agnieszka,"The house is an an excellent location: Close to public transport, close to little stores and restaurants, etc. The room I received was very clean and felt private (it has a code-entry door, so did not have to bother remembering to take keys everywhere, which is surprisingly convenient). The kitchen area has lots of tea, a fridge for visitor use, and is functional. It felt safe and cozy to stay in the room.

The only negative -- and this is not a negative about the house, just a matter of circumstance -- is the ventilation. It was HOT when I was there (in the 90s all three days!) and lack of AC was a bit of a pain. Fortunately, it would cool during the night :)

Overall, would recommend strongly, but maybe be a little cautious during expected heat waves."
6106997,78978446,2016-06-10,13256251,Elle,"This house was a great place to stay. The house mum, Sharon, was so helpful and welcoming when I arrived. It's secure and on a main street with nice shops, bars and restaurants around. Public transport is easy to access but I preferred to walk the 45 minutes downtown. Would highly recommend staying here!"
6106997,80236402,2016-06-17,16367957,Diana,"It was great that I could instant-book this place, as I found myself unexpectedly in Portland for the night.  The hosts responded to my questions pretty quickly.  The place itself is the kind of Airbnb offering that is more hostel than a room in a home, which probably also makes it easier to instant-book, with numbers on the rooms, signs, posted notes.  The decor is a blend of funky charm and friendly shab.  Sharon, the house mom, was very friendly and accommodating, bringing me an extra blanket and heater.  The neighborhood is fun, with a Peets coffee a stones throw away, which reassured my Berkeley heart, a great taco place, fun little pubs, and you can get a massage at about every other store front.  I wouldn't stay here if I was going to want to spend a lot of time in my room, as it overlooks a parking lot, and I had to keep blinds closed for privacy.  The streets also busy, and the house close to the street, but I slept well anyways, as the bed was really comfy, with lots of pillows.  Wasn't the most beautiful room, but I was in Portland, so I only wanted the room for safety and sleep.  It felt homey, and safe, and I slept well, so I was happy."
6106997,80952571,2016-06-20,75392112,Brett,"Sharon was a great host!  Great place, close to tons of things to do.  Highly recommended!"
6106997,82413159,2016-06-27,10036721,Matt,Nice place 
6106997,82782618,2016-06-29,69793345,Ian,"Accessible, clean, and with knowledgeable hosts. Not a single problem to be found."
3646070,16379709,2014-07-26,506078,Patricia,"I had the pleasure of staying in Jason's studio in Irvington. The studio was clean, the neighborhood lovely, and the rest of Portland was easily accessible by riding the #8 bus.
When I entered there were fresh flowers on the table and even a bowl of cherries from the farmers market. Jason is the apotheosis of hospitality, and he was very accommodating to when I invariably forgot something here and there.

I even rented one of Jason's bikes for the week, and got to bike around to wherever I needed to go.

The bed was incredibly comfortable, the shower was of a perfect temperature, and the room opens up into the backyard. 

I spent most mornings walking through the residential streets, taking in the grand architecture. I can think of no better place to stay in Portland than here, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit. :)"
3646070,16688500,2014-07-31,4901507,Jennifer,"I had a great 5-night stay in Portland in the studio apartment in Irvington. The neighborhood was so beautiful, with its tree-lined streets and historic homes, and the location was perfect for exploring the city. I loved walking around the corner for coffee or a glass of wine and checking out all the nearby parks. Jason was very welcoming, friendly, and helpful in getting me oriented. It was enough to make me want to come back... "
3646070,17138527,2014-08-07,19518499,Gordon,"Jason's studio is a great little slice of Portland. The listing was clean and just as advertised. The hot tub was also clean and at a wonderfully relaxing temperature. The bed was comfortable and perfect for one or two. I would stay there again in a heartbeat while traveling to Portland for business or pleasure. Thanks very much, Jason!  10/10 Would recommend."
3646070,17302027,2014-08-10,17224658,Avery,"This was a great studio apartment.  It is located in the Irvington District in a 1920s split home.  Jason was an awesome host, I sent him a text and he left the key our for us because we arrived after 9pm on our check-in date. The apartment is awesome and located just blocks away from Broadway which has incredible food and bars.  The neighborhood made us want to move to Portland because it was so awesome and quiet.  The tree-lined streets made for incredible walks with our dog.  There is a great pub just around the corner from the place as well.  It was a great experience, we would definitely stay again.  We had our 3 year old lab with us the whole time and had no problems in Portland.  I would highly recommend this stay for anyone that travels with their pet.  "
3646070,17651941,2014-08-15,19448143,Ren√©e,"My partner and I had a wonderful stay in Jason's place. it was quiet, incredibly clean, and he gave a few nice touches that made it feel extra welcoming. He was totally top of communication which was so helpful when we finally made it into town and realized we still needed the house number. He texted back our dying phone within 2 minutes. 

The location was perfect - we got to see so much in our time there. Favourite place to brunch is the Alberta district which a not too far from the house. 

We loved it. Would recommend to anyone. "
3646070,17910443,2014-08-18,185997,Jacqueline,"This place is GREAT. We only stayed for one night but this place was so super charming that it made our whole trip seem longer and more memorable. The building has tons of character and the neighborhood is full of huge, beautiful old houses and trees. Jason made everything simple with fast and clear communication, and was very accommodating. The outdoor hot tub in the backyard was the best - it was in the back all ready to go when we arrived. So glad we chose this place!"
3646070,18214492,2014-08-23,1771553,Ashley,We had a  great time at Jason's  place! We brought 2 little dogs and it was easy to walk them around the beautiful neighborhood. There was plenty of parking and it was convenient to restaurants bars coffee shops etc. There was a vase of beatiful flowers for our arrival and the wifi codes were readily available.  We recommend it!
3646070,18431343,2014-08-26,19196103,Steven,"A very nice location, with excellent host.  The studio apartment is new to the airbnb market, so our observations (not requests at all) to the host about possible additions the furnishings (microwave, fan, small shelves for the bath) became near instantaneous events.  Host is most discrete, but very available and convivial.  Good choice for a couple.  Bath is snug but adequate.  Comfy down platform double bed.  Hot tub looks like a winner in cooler weather.  Very well stocked small kitchen.  Plenty of light.  Will stay again.  Fairly priced, if not a steal."
3646070,19208650,2014-09-08,223951,Kimberly,"I absolutely loved my stay! Jason was extremely accommodating and was very generous when I asked to check out late.
The apt is cozy & comfy & the bed was so perfect I didn't want to get up in the morning. It was everything I wanted. The neighborhood is drop dead gorgeous and perfect for long walks. Some of Portlands best restaurants are a few minutes away. 
I look forward to coming back soon!"
3646070,19697712,2014-09-16,1472039,Larissa,We had a wonderful stay! Our host was friendly and communicative.
3646070,20174747,2014-09-24,1592636,Jonathan,"The listing is accurate. The hot tub was ready on arrival, much appreciated. I did an instant booking and the check in was straight forward. Nice neighborhood with many options for  entertainment and eating, Secret Society and Toro Bravo. Privacy respected, just like living in the neighborhood for a day."
3646070,20934317,2014-10-07,10878170,Collin,Jason's studio apartment was great! The location was perfect in Northeast Portland.  Easy walk to everything you could need.  Pok Pok Noi is only a mile up 15th!  Apartment was clean and well appointed.  Everything we could have asked for.  We would definitely stay again!
3646070,21239072,2014-10-13,21815788,Matthew,This was a perfect place to spend a few days in portland.  Absolutely a beautiful neighborhood.  Short drive from everything.  The studio was very cozy and comfortable!  The host Jason was excellent and very friendly.  Would most definitely stay here again! 
3646070,21615034,2014-10-20,5032468,Amber,"The Irvington neighborhood is gorgeous. It was an incredible historic neighborhood to walk through and was very close and convenient to the other areas of Portland we wanted to visit. The hot tub was GREAT after a day of hiking Multnomah Falls. The unit itself was nice, but small, but it met our needs for our visit. The house it is in has 8 units, and it's an old house, so you can hear a lot of creaking and moving around if the other units are occupied. We only really stayed there to sleep, so it wasn't a huge deal - but if you are a sensitive sleeper this old home may not be for you. We had a rental car, but it was very close to the bus route and a bus trip to downtown took about 10 minutes. "
3646070,22045612,2014-10-28,14847892,Aaron,"Great place, quiet,!sweet hood.
Not super close to the desirable high streets but that's ok. 

I stayed here solo, it's about the size of small hotel from so a couple might feel cramped after a few days."
3646070,22346400,2014-11-03,3751080,Ashlie,"Jason was a great host! And the space was comfortable and clean. 
My bf and I visited during Halloween, and the neighborhood was a perfect setting for our adventure; colorful tree lined streets with an abundance of holiday cheer. 
Portland gets a little nippy in the autumn months, but the hot tub in the garden will warm you right up. "
3646070,22673798,2014-11-11,23133137,Mika,The studio was perfect for our trip. We didn't spend much time at the studio but it was great to have somewhere a bit more personal for our stay. The little hot tub in the back was a nice touch. Great neighbourhood central to transit and with quite a few available car2go's.
3646070,22806489,2014-11-15,22595533,Victoria,"Jason is an outstanding host. He is prompt in accommodating needs, and requests. The space is cozy and sweet. The bed is comfortable for a pleasant sleep. The neighborhood is wonderful, and close to everything. I will recommend him without a doubt!"
3646070,22971275,2014-11-18,14869911,Risa,"Jason was a wonderful host. He lives on the third floor above the studio and was on-site when we checked in. He offered us bikes for $10 (along with a lock and helmet) and gave us detailed suggestions of all the great restaurants, pubs, breweries and shops nearby, and the best streets to take to get there on bikes. It is clear that Jason loves Portland, and in particular this area of Portland, and is grateful for the opportunity to share his love with travelers. And all the places we visited on his recommendation were indeed great! 

The studio was just as it looked in the photos: clean, cute and comfortable. The bed was cozy, the kitchen was well stocked and most importantly, the hot-tub was blazing hot and easily accessible in the backyard. There is a big TV and fast internet for those who want to be connected. An overall great place to stay if you want to explore Northeast Portland, Mississippi Street and the Alberta Arts District on bicycles or by car, as there seemed to be ample parking as well."
3646070,23258239,2014-11-26,2449286,Maikel And Jenny,"Great location, quiet neighborhood, charming unit and very responsive host. Both thumbs up! "
3646070,23663392,2014-12-07,2872642,Casey,We had an emergency at home and never ended up going to the apt.
3646070,23711144,2014-12-08,16900599,Kate,Jason was very accommodating and the place was wonderful! Great location and a very cute apartment. Highly recommend!
3646070,24477473,2014-12-29,23461457,Ed,"Actually, our hosts virtually welcomed us at the front door. They happened to be decorating a Christmas tree with their little daughter and the tree was in the foyer. They let us in, gave us keys and pointed the way to our apartment."
3646070,25276414,2015-01-11,3675548,Hugh,"The unit was exactly as shown in the photos. Really beautiful neighborhood.  Jason was very communicative and amenable.

Only issue: we stayed there in January, and the first night was exceptionally cold for Portland in the winter.  The only heat in the unit was a small space heater that didn't do a whole lot.  It was freezing!  The other nights were fine, though."
3646070,25561415,2015-01-19,25546946,Eric,great place. we are most likely going to move to Portlnd and our stay here gave us a great first impression. awesome location. the basic nest did not let us down. thank you!
3646070,25622866,2015-01-20,1103227,Monica,"Really cute place, great location. Jason was very accommodating. "
3646070,25802854,2015-01-26,18104211,Tony,"The location of this place is amazing! We spent both mornings just walking around the neighborhood with out pup. There are lots of historic homes, with families and dogs walking/running through the neighborhood. The studio is charming and provided us everything we needed on our stay! We will definitely keep this  place in mind on a return trip to Portland. "
3646070,26103515,2015-02-03,7149589,Alexa,"We had a great stay at Jason's apartment.  Its such a nice quiet neighborhood, close to other areas in the North of the city. The apartment has everything you need with the kitchen and bathroom.  He has some great Portland guides to use, and the bikes were so useful around the city.  Couldn't recommend it more!"
3646070,26423734,2015-02-12,8950673,Jimmy,"Great location on quiet street of beautiful homes in the heart of historic Irvington district, one of the most beautiful neighborhoods of Portland.  But don't misjudge the quiet neighborhood:  just a two minute walk to #8 bus will get you to Alberta Arts neighborhood or downtown.  A wine/cheese bar and craft-beer bar also within two minutes.  Finally, less than 10-minute walk to shops and restaurants of NE Broadway, including Peet's coffee, Starbucks, and a McMenamin's pub; or in the other direction to a Whole Foods store and more neighborhood restaurants.
Relaxing hot tub always ready for a dip."
3646070,26953785,2015-02-22,26883590,Jack,"Our host was very friendly and responsive to emails and texts. 

The studio is very nicely located with a easy parking on the street. We were able to use the studio as a base to drive around and explore both Northeast and Southeast Portland.

There are two entrances to the studio, one directly from the back and another from the main entrance. both of which are good.

Only minor thing for me is that the bed is quite soft, but that's more of a personal preference."
3646070,27492772,2015-03-06,10149028,Matthew,"Great location, easy to walk to a lot of cool restaurants and venues."
3646070,27795183,2015-03-12,18613039,Cherry,"Great experience -- Irvington is located in the NE part of Portland, but easy enough to get to downtown or the other little neighborhoods outside of downtown by foot, bike, or public transit.  Jason was a great host, rented a couple bikes to us for our second day in PDX, and the studio was as pictured/expected.  Small library in the foyer area has some interesting books on things to do/eat/see around the area.  "
3646070,29507494,2015-04-08,12403431,Vick,Jason was a great host! We were provided with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. This little studio was perfectly located in a beautiful neighborhood just a short ride from downtown Portland. The hot tub was extremely enjoyable on cold misty evenings. We were able to cook in the kitchen and enjoy the local Hophouse. Would recommend to a friend. Thanks Jason!
3646070,30725325,2015-04-26,959150,Jamie,"We had a great stay at Jason's place. It's an easy walk into downtown and even closer by the streetcar. However, I'd suggest exploring the neighborhood around you, too. Lots of great restaurants and shops; Jason and his very sweet girls were also full of suggestions. 
The apartment is clean, cozy, and quiet. Has everything you'd need for a comfortable stay. I'd definitely recommend and stay again. Thanks, Jason!"
3646070,31074559,2015-05-01,16317612,Nicholas,Jason was a great host. He was very accommodating and the whole experience went off without a hitch. The suite itself is very open and beautiful and the garden was a lovely addition. Everything was clean and inviting and I could not ask for a better stay. Thanks Jason! 
3646070,31230833,2015-05-03,17623904,Kristof,"We were blow away by the beauty and location of Jasons house!  Our room was very clean and well kept. Jason was a excellent host, even agreed to let us alter our reservation last minute.  The property exceeded expectations and we can't wait to come back!   Best stay in Portland ever!  Thanks Jason!"
3646070,31659780,2015-05-08,506871,Sarah,"Wish we could've stayed longer! Great location, beautiful neighborhood and house, cute studio. Bed was very comfortable. And hot tub a big bonus!! (Too much good food in Portland to take advantage of the kitchen.)"
3646070,32567135,2015-05-19,2525795,Dana,"I really enjoyed staying here. Place was in a great location, quiet, and looks just as cute as in the photos. Jason was there if I had any questions. I'd definitely stay here again. "
3646070,33257872,2015-05-26,33482,Lisa,"Room was just as described and pictured!  Very good, basic amenities.  Complimentary tea and coffee was helpful.  Lovely neighborhood, easy access to wherever you want to go in Portland.  Jason was responsive when we had a challenging time using the keys on the front door.  Nice fluffy towels, having a full kitchen was very helpful to stock up on some supplies.  The hot tub was awesome to have access to, except that there were no instructions and it got cold on our third day there.  

We had a fabulous time hanging out, having a chill weekend and pampering ourselves with lots of hot tub time!  Would recommend!"
3646070,33546735,2015-05-29,2155504,TIffany,"This is an awesome apartment. The location is stellar. The hot tub is a couple of steps from the back door. Very comfortable bed and light, bright apartment. Small, but full kitchen and bathroom with everything you need. This is a perfect spot for a stay in Portland. 

Jason also very generously let us park our packed-to-the-roof (and on top) vehicle in the drive the first night we were there until we could access our storage unit the next morning."
3646070,33834406,2015-06-01,3826514,Sarah,Beautiful space with everything we needed. Took full advantage of the hot tub. Seamless check in.
3646070,34258738,2015-06-06,32167975,Regina And Izzy,"We stayed here for the first two nights of our Oregon wedding trip and it was perfect! We felt very safe and loved how much natural light the space had. We enjoyed the hot tub as well. Thanks, Jason!"
3646070,34557303,2015-06-09,3399306,Katy,"The apartment was very nice and tidy, and the neighborhood was beautiful and quiet, as well as convenient for us. Everything was as described and we were quite comfortable in our stay. There was some mix up with the cleaning before we arrived, but Jason quickly remedied this."
3646070,34883820,2015-06-13,33501050,Lucas,"Jason was awesome.. 

My prior stay was interrupted due to my failure to jump on the reservation, so I lost days in between, but Jason was super helpful and offered me his studio in lieu of my lost days. He was a great help and it kept me on the same building and block in Irvington which was very helpful. I would stay here again in a flash.. Super comfy and easy access and quiet house. Very clean, and always helpful for any needs. There is even a laundry in the basement.. Awesome.. Could not be happier, well I could be if I actually lived in this neighborhood.. "
3646070,35122044,2015-06-15,33791516,Eric,"This was a great spot. It accomplished all of the needs we had. It's definitely in a more residential portion of town, nice and quiet. Jason was very accommodating to any requests we had like advice on places to hike, as well as being flexible on exact arrival/departure. Would stay here again."
3646070,35961383,2015-06-23,6136574,Salvatore,"Thanks to Jason, our stay in Portland was exceptional. His familiarity with the city proved invaluable‚the food and event suggestions he provided did not disappoint.

The room was clean, cozy, and functional. It had everything we needed for stay. The neighborhood felt safe and tranquil."
3646070,36549494,2015-06-29,17467581,Megan,"We had such a great stay at Jason's place! The neighborhood is quiet, peaceful, and beautiful; great to take walks around after dinner. The studio is comfortable and we had everything we needed. The weekend we visited was 99+ degrees, so Jason provided us with a tower fan to cool off the room (which was a life saver to help us sleep at night). He was very accommodating with our schedule, which was early check-in and late check-out, and made sure we were comfortable. Would definitely come back again!"
3646070,37346288,2015-07-06,709679,Megan,"Jason was an excellent host! He stopped by to say hello, brought his super cute pup to greet us, and gave us a list of wonderful restaurant recommendations to try in the NE. He also told us a brief history of the neighborhood and his own building. 

There was quite the heatwave happening in Portland during our trip, but Jason provided a tower fan for us to use throughout our stay. It was more than enough to keep us cool in the evening and circulate the air during the day. We returned a couple of afternoons for cat naps and found it quite pleasant. 

Irvington is such a fascinating part of town, and we loved the home, the neighborhood and the accommodations. The studio is small but cozy and meets all the comfort needs. We couldn't have found a better place to lay our heads and enjoy the wonderful PNW summer weather.

We hope to return and try one of the other rental units in this home, because enjoyed it so much! Thank you Jason!!!"
3646070,37912037,2015-07-11,30435157,Agnes,Jason was very friendly and gave us a lot of local recommendations. He was available if we needed anything and always provided feedback  quickly.  The Studio was very cute and cozy just like the neighborhood. We felt like locals and it was a great airbnb experience.   
3646070,39180803,2015-07-21,35341131,Rebecca,"We had a wonderful stay! The apartment was as described, but more spacious than we expected. Jason was friendly and helpful. The neighborhood was charming and a great location for experiencing Portland. We would definitely stay there again!"
3646070,41986891,2015-08-10,37736025,MacKenzie,The home was cozy and sweet. The hot tub was warm and the garden lovely and inviting. Jason left us local coffee and we had everything we needed for a couple days in town. We'd happily return!
3646070,43061115,2015-08-17,3317405,Yeowon,Jason's studio #2 was a very nice and cozy. and Jason was so kind for my request. Thank you again. :) 
3646070,44338605,2015-08-25,9728665,Marco,"The unit was great and as described. It was clean, and in a beautiful neighborhood. We also enjoyed renting the bikes, which made our stay in Portland more convenient. Also Jason was kind enough to allow us to leave our bags in the foyer for the rest of the day after our check out."
3646070,45040798,2015-08-30,35589510,Gerald,"Jason made everything easy. He gave us a quick response to our request and had all the details ready for our stay. The studio was  comfortable and quiet, and the neighborhood was the perfect place to explore the city in any direction. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. "
3646070,45441526,2015-09-02,12765236,Jana,This place was a perfect little home just the right distance from the city. Loved it and would stay there again.
3646070,45994314,2015-09-07,1675274,Simon,"Very nice and simple studio. We had no complaints about it, made the perfect home for our short stay in Portland"
3646070,48403732,2015-09-26,13726600,Peter,"The apartment's description was precise and as expected. The neighborhood is quiet and relaxed. Still, it's easily accessible from the airport (45min) and you can get quick downtown (10min by bike). Jason was very helpful and answered all questions we had in advance quickly. We completely enjoyed our stay."
3646070,48738667,2015-09-28,250072,Cassie,"We had a great weekend in this studio! The bed was comfy, all the amenities (towels, kitchen stuff, etc) that we needed were there, and it was very clean. It's also located in a really lovely, charming neighborhood. We really enjoyed the hot tub, as well. Our only complaint was that it was a little loud. People from another one of the apartments were in the hot tub after us and we could hear them as clearly as if they were in the room with us. It was after the posted ""quiet hours"" on the welcome sheet, so I guess we could have said something, but they weren't really being loud, just talking in normal voices. There was a fan in the studio that helped drown out the noise, which was nice. We'd stay here again for sure!"
3646070,49669010,2015-10-05,281428,Mike,"Host was accommodating and let us leave luggage near the unit for an early checkin. The weekend was a little chilly and the apartment didn't have the central heater turned on yet, but the host found us a portable heater which worked well. Having the bikes to rent was great for exploring Portland."
3646070,51366008,2015-10-19,45618514,Slav,"A great location that is very close to public transport. A nice studio that accommodates 2 just fine, and the hot tub is a pretty nice way to end the day. If you are looking for things to do, Jason can give you more than you will have time for. Great stay overall!"
3646070,54168718,2015-11-16,47935622,Matt,My partner and I really enjoyed our stay at Jason's studio. It's located in a nice historic neighbourhood which had easy access to transit downtown and pretty close Whole Foods for grocery shopping. The studio was as advertised and the bed was comfortable. Jason's partner greeted us when we checked in and she gave us some helpful tips on good restaurants. We would definitely stay there again.  
3646070,55262942,2015-11-29,4089196,Bridget,"Jason's apartment exactly fit the bill for what we were looking for on our more recent trip to Portland! The studio was exactly as described - clean and comfortable. The weather that time of year was bitterly cold so Jason was kind enough to leave a space heater for us which was awesome; it warmed the entire room so quickly! Also the location can't be beat. Easy walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops, and only a block from one of the main bus lines. Couldn't have asked for a better stay. "
3646070,55524780,2015-12-01,49654019,Mysa,"The place was cute and as pictured and the hot tub out back was relaxing and wonderful to come back to after a long day.  The neighbourhood felt safe, was quite, and nice a residential while being close to good places to eat and drink. A nice little get away."
3646070,55704829,2015-12-04,3665540,Corey,Easy check in and quick response/very helpful host. The kitchen was amazing as well- perfect for coffee and breakfast every morning..
3646070,56526732,2015-12-14,1168085,Ed,"Great little place in a really beautiful neighbourhood. Close to amenities and transport links. The hot tub is perfect, right by the back door to the apartment so you can even jump in for a dip before bed time. Or relax watching something in the roku. We really enjoyed staying there."
3646070,57405818,2015-12-25,7765302,Sheila,"We didn't get to meet Jason (or anyone) but everything was where it was supposed to be, when it was supposed to be there and any issues we had via email were responded to quickly while we were out. The room gets a little cold (we went in December) but there is a space heater to help out. And yes, the hot tub is where you want to be. "
3646070,59394319,2016-01-10,19861745,Melanie,"Very nice stay, only stayed one night but everything was great. Clean and cozy!"
3646070,59546072,2016-01-11,36437889,Sierra,"This charming stufio proved to be just how the pictures showed, very homey and comfortable. Safe area! Close to anything you may need, grocery store, restaurants, bars. Etc etc. Very clean and quiet :) 
Would 100% recommend! "
3646070,59878689,2016-01-16,51475192,Grace,"This place was great, really felt like home! We didn't ever meet Jason, but everything was smooth as far as check in/out. Very easy and cozy home to stay in, everything you need is there. "
3646070,59985129,2016-01-17,18062948,‚° Jason,"Tiffany was really nice when she greeted us but we never met Jason. We didn't know that we were sharing a house with other people so it was a bit surprising. The studio has most of the things we need. However, the bathroom was really small and there was no soap. The room gets really cold at night. Also, We felt quite uncomfortable because 10pm is quiet time and we are afraid to bother others while we talk because the walls were very thin and you can hear everything. Other than that we really like the location, it is very close to a lot of good restaurant if you are a foody. We would still think that with the same price, we could get a lot better than this place."
3646070,60162993,2016-01-19,25205080,Victoria,"This was an awesome find for a little weekend getaway to Portland. The room was clean, the location was central to everywhere we wanted to explore, and the hot tub was the cherry on top. "
3646070,60597176,2016-01-25,24211868,Natalie,We had a great time in Jason's apartment. It was a very well-appointed space that had everything we needed for a short weekend trip. We loved the hot tub directly out the back door. Jason was also very communicative and quick to answer any questions we had. 
3646070,61731230,2016-02-07,7409364,Ryan,"This place is perfect. It has an amazing open, relaxed feel. Jason was really easy to communicate with and made the stay everything we were hoping for. Definitely looking forward to staying here again
Thanks!"
3646070,62054440,2016-02-10,17016114,Jeff,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3646070,62700778,2016-02-16,488665,Dave,Jason was a great host. He made the entire experience very enjoyable. The bikes were a great way to get to know the charming neighbourhood. The hot tub was a perfect way to relax after a long day of sightseeing. Thanks!

3646070,65647089,2016-03-16,25733224,Kalyn,"The air bnb was in a great location in  Irvington. It was clean and nice but I think for the price I could have found something better, the walls were a bit thin."
3646070,66518142,2016-03-23,13103934,Jon,"My partner and I loved staying at the Irvington Studio! It's such a cozy studio! The space had all what we needed. We enjoyed so much the hot tub after long walks and hikes in Portland. The check-in and check-out process was very easy and Jason was able to accommodate our schedules (thanks again Jason!). The neighborhood is really peaceful and safe, and really close to so many good restaurants and beautiful shops. The location was very convenient as it's close to downtown (about 10 min drive) as well as streets like Mississippi, Williams and Alberta. We'd definitely stay here again if we come back to Portland!"
3646070,67978427,2016-04-01,1822326,Tabitha & Robbie,"Jason was friendly and a great host, easy check-in, place was clean, simplistic and comfortable.  Very nice neighborhood to walk or bike in and around. He even mailed me back my nice sunglasses I left behind.  Thanks!"
3646070,68564727,2016-04-05,29578501,Katie,"One of the best airbnbs I've stayed in. Super easy to get to, clean, and welcoming with great customer support. Highly recommend for a Portland vacation. "
3646070,71155705,2016-04-24,1907412,Jill,"This space was perfectly located for a week in Portland‚easy to explore all sections of the city by foot or public transit. Tons of natural light, plenty of space for two, and the hot tub was a welcome treat after a long day of walking. Jason was easy to contact and responsive, and hands-off the rest of the time. Great host, great space!"
3646070,72489528,2016-05-02,560709,Charleene,"The place was located in a very nice, quiet neighborhood. Definitely a plus since we rented a car and there was plenty of street parking. The studio wasn't bad. It could use to be updated a bit but for the price. "
3646070,73658430,2016-05-09,15135408,Samantha,The place was great. Easy to park on the street - very close to public transit. Was perfect for our mini trip to Portland! 
3646070,74992908,2016-05-18,72180577,Alyssa,Cute neighborhood. Clean apartment. Host made us feel welcome and left information on things to do in the area. We actually read the book that listed tons of ideas to do in Portland. Very cute and cozy little place. 
3646070,76307273,2016-05-26,71724537,Robert,"Great host and nice listing! Would definitely stay here again.

Thank you!"
3646070,77381254,2016-05-31,181192,Jennifer,"This was a nice little apartment in a gorgeous, quiet neighborhood. Jason was there when I checked in to answer any questions, and he provided a house manual with tips for using public transportation and great suggestions for local restaurants and things to do. The bus is a block away and it's easy to get pretty much anywhere around town by bus or rail. (I suggest downloading the TriMet transit app and buying a day pass.) It's a quick ride to the convention center (where I was attending a conference) and light rail station or up to the Alberta district. There's a Whole Foods a few blocks away for whatever else you need. The bed was comfy, the kitchen had all the essentials, and the hot tub was lovely after a day of walking around town. The quiet hours from 10pm-7am are a plus, in my book. There were folks staying in the adjoining apartment, but I heard nary a peep out of them at night!"
3646070,79183905,2016-06-11,58015233,Grit,"The apartment is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood. The bikes were perfect to explore Portland. Tiffany welcomed us warm and friendly and didn't get tired answering all our questions. I can truly recommend staying with Jason. "
3646070,79708283,2016-06-13,8717850,Clare,Everything was very easy. The neighborhood was really lovely and we enjoyed making this our base. 
3646070,80089128,2016-06-16,3133489,Joep&Enzo,"We had a great stay at Jason's place! It has everything you would want from
a hotel without feeling as sterile as a hotel. A real authentic home-away-from-home feeling in a beautiful house. Portland is a great city as well, would definitely recommend staying here! Location is good to visit the city."
3646070,81075422,2016-06-20,6315943,Alyssa,Description was very accurate! The apartment was super easy to find and in the cutest neighborhood walking distance to coffee shops and cafes. Room was very cute and clean plus the hot tub was a great bonus.
3646070,81276901,2016-06-22,1290056,Fynn,"Jason's home was perfect, and exactly what I needed. The location is in a beautiful neighborhood, and the studio is clean, comfortable, and cozy. I'd highly recommend staying here, and Jason is incredibly responsive and helpful. "
3646070,81410092,2016-06-22,78713226,Matt,"The neighborhood is really nice and charming, so safety wasn't an issue.  The location was 20 minutes from anywhere in the city of Portland.  Room was big enough and the bed was comfy. "

7311095,38672839,2015-07-17,38343775,Nicholas,"Fantastic first Airbnb experience (as the renter) with the very responsive and most friendly Jessica & Drew! Private back house is well described, spacious and simply comfortable. Even though I was only there three nights, having the mini-kitchen with a freezer box and toaster was really nice (grocery store but a block away). Great neighborhood location and really nice feeling ""coming home"" here. Super cool dog who's just as happy to leave you alone as he is to engage when you're hanging out on the porch.

Internet could be a challenge today, but I understand  improvements are coming and connection wasn't an issue for me as I had a strong signal from a some nearby Comcast Xfinity box and my personal Xfinity roaming login. T-Mobile and AT&T both had good connections in the room as well."
7311095,39107942,2015-07-20,31828245,Devin,"A wonderful, private spot and a great price! Jessica and Drew were great hosts and made things very comfortable. Space is quiet, clean and very cozy and busy Alberta Street is a short walk away...Would highly recommend it to anyone"
7311095,39238330,2015-07-21,36539543,Megan,Jessica and Drew were great hosts and made us feel extremely welcome. They were super helpful in giving us suggestions for places to go in the area and made us feel as though we were staying with friends rather than people we had only just met.  Jessica and Drew were readily available for anything we needed but also respected us having our own space in their studio guest house.  The studio was clean and cozy and we were able to get a great night's sleep before flying out the next morning.  The location was only about 15 minutes to the airport which was another great perk.  Thank you to Jessica and Drew for sharing their home with us!  We would absolutely stay here again if and and when we are back in the area!
7311095,39681544,2015-07-25,27738156,Jenny,"This was an excellent, and perfectly advertised experience. Drew and Jessica were extremely friendly, and accommodating. 

Thank you guys for a wonderful stay!"

7311095,40526688,2015-07-31,645802,John,"Jessica and Drew have a great place to stay while in Portland. It is very centrally located and a short walk away from Alberta st. with its many shops and restaurants. We had a car so all of the other nice neighborhoods and sights were easy to get to.
The flat was very clean and stocked with the necessary comforts to help you with your stay. Jessica and Drew were great host as they were very attentive and very quick to respond to our inquiries. I highly recommend their flat during your stay in Portland. "
7311095,41428507,2015-08-07,36911852,Elizabeth,"Perfect location. Walking distance to tonnes of cool shops, neat places to eat, and transit to the rest of the city. Pictures and description were totally accurate. Suite was nice and private. Jess and Drew were super helpful and knowledgeable about Portland. They were really nice and their dog Bowser was a big sweetie. We would definitely stay with them again. "
7311095,41681018,2015-08-08,13405910,Adam,The Hideaway was a very nice place to stay the night before flying out the next morning.  Jessica was super nice and accommodating and the location was great. Couldn't have had a better experience there.
7311095,42167951,2015-08-11,1509074,Emily,"Our weekend in Jessica and Drew's little hideaway was absolutely perfect. It's located in the Northeast part of Portland, and so close to everything and anything you could possibly need. Their neighborhood has a super chill vibe and is only about a 15 minute bike ride downtown to the city center. We took Jess and Drew's recommendations from their Airbnb guidebook for everything, and it was all perfect. We'd definitely recommend staying with them in Portland!"
7311095,42566943,2015-08-14,38681623,Jen,"The Concordia Hideaway was better than advertised!  Jess and Drew thought of everything from extra toiletries to a bottle opener.   It was like staying at a hotel, if not better.  Jess and Drew made us feel extremely welcome.  One of our favorite nights in Portland was sitting on the deck, drinking beers with Jess, Drew and Bowser.  We would definitely stay here again!"
7311095,43534806,2015-08-20,39758584,Catherine,"Jessica and Drew were very welcoming and provided a great experience. The cottage was comfortable, clean and supplied well (cutlery, dishes, coffee, towels, etc.). I enjoyed sitting in the back yard and enjoyed being within walking distance to stores, coffee shops and restaurants. Jessica and Drew have done a great job in creating a great space for travelers-SO MUCH BETTER than a hotel. I'd like to return and stay again!"
7311095,43822142,2015-08-22,6491465,Shena,Jessica and Drew were a breeze to communicate with. There backyard hideaway worked great for our quick stay in Portland. The location was great for accessing multiple neighborhoods. We would stay again anytime!
7311095,44160704,2015-08-24,32911247,Ashley,"This was such a great place to stay for our two nights in Alberta! Location close to so many wonderful restaurants and grocery store. Lovely home, comfy bed and they made us feel right at home. Safe neighborhood to walk at night. They left tea and beer for us and great toiletries. I was worried because I forgot my portable fan but there was a great oscillating fan there already. They really thought of everything. I'd like to stay here again the next time we visit Portland."
7311095,46174568,2015-09-08,27331061,Mark,I have stayed in a number AirBnb's and have no problem saying that this is the best accommodation ever. So much thought has gone into this charming place and I firmly believe this is THE place to stay in Portland. Jessica & Drew are delightful hosts and will recommend their home to anyone visiting Portland. Thx!
7311095,46603389,2015-09-12,6936618,Marc,Great hosts and very friendly people. We loved our stay at their place.  It was clean and offered everything we needed. Located within walking distance of  Alberta st for good food and an excellent place to stay to explore the nature surrounding Portland.
7311095,46987661,2015-09-14,43521578,Angeline,Perfect stay! Drew was very welcoming and gave us some good tips for our trip. Space was great and will definitely look to stay here again if we make a trip back to Portland. The new outdoor deck was very nice to sit out on at night with the patio lights. Great neighborhood! We even went one place two nights in a row because the food was good. 
7311095,47188382,2015-09-16,24862835,Aaron,"We had a great time staying at the hideaway. The bed was comfortable, and the heater worked great during the cold evenings. Just a short walk to shops and food on Alberta. Would definitely recommend!"
7311095,48388688,2015-09-26,9485479,Melissa,"Drew and Jessica's studio worked well for us during our time in Portland.  They have done an amazing job with a relatively small space... it is very functional and quite charming.  The location is great.  We enjoyed the nearby Kennedy School and New Seasons Market... a block away in either direction. 
After we left, we discovered that we were missing my husband's wallet and thought maybe we had left it behind.  They were very helpful and did everything in their power to help us find it, including meeting us at the house to let us look ourselves.  I appreciated their prompt communication from start to finish.  "
7311095,48725138,2015-09-28,7550275,Anna,"Concordia Hideaway way roomy and comfortable. Our dog, Dutch, loved being able to run around a bit in the room and the beautiful yard. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was amazing.

Having a small fridge with a working freezer was also wonderful, as we were traveling with ice packs for our cooler."
7311095,49607327,2015-10-05,1119771,Jason,"What a perfect spot to stay for my first AirBnB experience! Jessica was great with communication from booking up until check-out. The Hideaway is a cozy quiet spot ideal for two.  It's location makes it a breeze accessing nearby local hot spots - restaurants, bars, etc. As others have already pointed out, the bed was very comfortable, and having mini fridge available was nice. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a spot in Portland. "
7311095,49954218,2015-10-07,23780018,Ash Andrew,"My husband and I were so fortunate to book with Jessica and Drew on such short notice. They were very communicative and accommodating to our traveling needs even allowing us to check in early to drop off our bags since we would have otherwise had difficulty lugging them around along with our six month old baby. 

Jessica came out to greet us and show us the way to the guest house and was very friendly. Even friendliness aside, they also have an adorable (and just as friendly) dog and what I can only describe as a very beautifully put together guest house. 

The interior decor is really refreshing, bright and welcoming as is the privacy and spaciousness. We really enjoyed our stay there and appreciated the bath and hand towels that were included. We also got good use out of the mini fridge and when my husband needed to study, he was able to do so comfortably on the ample counter/dining space. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone planning to be in the area because it is so easy to get around on the buses and light rail and it is well worth your money. "
7311095,50020678,2015-10-08,28934384,Jesse,"Very highly recommended! This is a really cute rental--Drew and Jessica have done a lot of work to convert it into a nice, relaxing space. The yard is super nice as well. The neighborhood is great--super close to Kennedy School, walking distance to New Seasons and other Killingsworth-area amenities. Even though it's fairly close to 33rd you don't hear much road noise at all."
7311095,50237818,2015-10-10,40331604,Diane,Enjoyed our first airbnb stay! Much better then a hotel. Very clean and cozy. Nice neighborhood. The place had everything we needed including a French press and coffee/ tea. 
7311095,50458848,2015-10-12,34835929,Melissa,"The hideaway was quiet, comfy and in an awesome neighborhood close to mostly everything we wanted to do or see. The shower was fantastic and very nice after a long day of flying. Jessica and drew were very accommodating and didn't mind that we were getting in super late at night. Would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Portland!"
7311095,51055988,2015-10-17,1223365,Tim,"We had a great time at the Concordia Hideaway. The space is very private, easy to find and close to a bunch of fun restaurants and bars. Jessica and Drew were super friendly and responsive. Highly Recommended!"

The Kennedy school is just next door and the Alberta Arts District is a short walk away. We found it very easy to get around on the buses. There is also a good supermarket around the corner.  We briefly met Jessica,  Drew (and Bowzer!); they were very friendly and accommodating. We would be happy to stay here again if we come back to Portland!"
7311095,52325103,2015-10-28,5552738,Sally,"It's hard to imagine a better setup than Drew and Jessica's!  NE Portland is a great neighborhood -- easily walkable, quiet, lots to do.  Their private, separate studio is quiet and very comfortable.  I will return over and over!"

7311095,54241825,2015-11-17,14485015,Alex & Rosa,"We loved staying here! The studio was clean and comfortable, and located in a great area. It is walking distance from the Alberta Arts District where there are tons of cute stores and yummy food (Waffle Window, Petite Provence, Salt & Straw). A few doors down from the studio is the McMenamins Kennedy School where you can have some drinks, food, and watch a fun movie in a neat little theater. We met Jessica and Drew briefly, and they seemed like friendly, lovely people. We would love to stay here again on our next trip to Portland."
7311095,54437001,2015-11-20,5347476,Lauren,"This place was a total private hideaway, exactly what we needed - a little place to relax and unwind.  It was close to the airport and less than a block from the Kennedy School! Its just like it's pictured and we had a wonderful time. "
7311095,54747802,2015-11-23,16680848,Chris,"Easy check-in, cute little place, absolutely nothing to complain about. A great experience "
7311095,54927906,2015-11-25,1046134,Kristin,Jessica and Drew's place was terrific for what we needed (a one night stopover on a road trip from Seattle to LA). Very comfy bed and cute kitchenette/dining area. No trouble with street parking and Jessica was very responsive to any questions I had. It's right down the block from McMenamin's Kennedy School so we were able to check that out and grab dinner the night we got in. Definitely would recommend a stay at their place!
7311095,55062677,2015-11-27,3880226,Lev,Jessica and Drew's cottage was conveniently located in the Alberta arts district. Parking was easy and they had great communication and instructions. Thanks!
7311095,55935436,2015-12-07,10923358,Maria,"This was an AMAZING place to stay. Very comfortable, well decorated & maintained, very clean, and just a super cozy living space. The bed was great and I slept very well, which is a compliment since I have back problems and don't do well on a lot of mattresses. It was very easy to get in contact with Jessica and Drew and even easier to get into the place. Good location that is central to a lot of neat places and is close to an excellent grocery store when I didn't want to eat out. I would recommend this place to anybody and will definitely stay here again if I'm in the Portland area!"
7311095,56599370,2015-12-15,5700109,Sue,The location of the Concordia Hideaway was perfect for us as we were near family and did not have to rent a car.  Jessica was very accommodating and allowed us to have an early check in.  The room was just what we needed with a comfortable bed and bathroom and the ability to regulate the heat in each room.  We would stay here again.
7311095,56855752,2015-12-19,5913292,Vincent,Very cute place in a nice neighborhood with easy free street parking. Located 30 mins away from Multnomah falls and 20 mins from downtown makes it very accessible to plan your trip/activities. Hosts were very accommodating and flexible. Place is furnished and equipped with essential needs and decorated well. Made my first experience on airbnb delightful. 
7311095,58196178,2016-01-01,50526343,Adriane,"This was a very cute, private place to stay in a great area of Portland. Parking is free and easy on the streets near the house, and it's two doors down from the awesome Kennedy school! Drew and Jessica (and their dog Bowser) were very kind and hospitable during our stay!"
7311095,58833977,2016-01-05,47852646,Jesse,"Great location, loved that there was a concert right next door... Clean accommodations, comfortable bed, overall a great experience! "
7311095,59248106,2016-01-08,7040100,Regina,"This place was beautiful, clean & very cozy. A comfortable bed and a code lock on the door for convenient check in and check out. Jessica was easy and thorough in communication & there was even a gated backyard to hang out in with our dog. A great place, definitely recommend it!"
7311095,59502279,2016-01-11,39562971,Peer,"Great location! Everything was as advertised. Just around the corner from McMenamins Kennedy School, and well worth the price. The bed was comfy and it was nice to have the microwave and refrigerator. Got to meet Drew and Bowser in the morning, on our way out. We had a question about parking and had our answer back in just minutes. We'll be back! "
7311095,60023265,2016-01-18,8685959,Tanishia,"Great listing and awesome location in Portland! Jessica and Drew were very responsive and helpful during my stay. The space is exactly as it is shown in the photos. It was well appointed, comfortable (the bed is amazing) and the perfect size for a solo traveler. It's also near amazing restaurants and a 10-15 minute drive to downtown Portland. The next time I'm in Portland, I will definitely check their listing first!"
7311095,60424444,2016-01-23,11704221,Caryn,"Jessica & Drew's place was lovely! It was a quiet & relaxing backyard oasis. And the bed was heavenly! So many options were right out the door or a short walk away like the Kennedy School, Alberta street and New Seasons market. Also plenty of street parking nearby. I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in town!"
7311095,60578894,2016-01-25,23075818,Josh,"Really great place. Super nice location, walkable to Kennedy School (literally across the street) and Alberta Arts district. We didn't actually meet the hosts, but they were wonderfully responsive and informative through text and email, super easy to work with. Place was spotless and really cozy. Bed was also really comfortable too."
7311095,60996768,2016-01-30,32146478,Denise,"What an adorable little studio!  Jessica and Drew's apt was spotless and charming.  Excellent location, cozy setting.  I would recommend this listing to anyone visiting PDX!  "

7311095,61686151,2016-02-07,16182138,Chandra,This was one of my favorite Airbnb's I've ever rented. It has a small kitchen that is set up with enough space to prep food and there is a little fridge for storing your groceries. It's literally right next door to Kennedy School which is a fun spot. I went over to the soaking tub there one night and I can't tell you how incredibly relaxing it was soaked in the rain. The Alberta Arts District is a few blocks away and its literally less than a block away from New Seasons which which is a great health food store. Jessica and Drew were so responsive and incredibly helpful. I can't say enough good things about this place. It's beautifully appointed and I will definitely come back!
7311095,61999782,2016-02-10,12273094,Sarah,We had a wonderful time staying at the cottage! Super cute and simple- exactly what we needed! Jessica was totally accommodating when we arrived early and asked to drop our bags off which was really nice of her. 
7311095,62185085,2016-02-12,56104322,Joel,The room was very nice and cozy. We had everything that we needed. The bed was really comfortable and the location was nice. Everything is pretty close. Also the bottle of wine for our birthdays was very thoughtful and appreciated! Thanks for a great experience guys.
7311095,62758378,2016-02-16,37440891,Jeff,Awesome place in an even better location! We never actually met Jessica and Drew which is too bad because they seem like a great couple! Thet were very responsive and friendly in our correspondence. Everything was as advertised and we will definitely try to stay there the next time we're in Portland.
7311095,63743599,2016-02-26,15243552,Samantha,"What a lovely spot. I would highly recommend it for either one person, or a couple. There's just the right amount of room, considering that the neighborhood is so amazing that you're always out walking and checking out the bars, sights, restaurants, etc."
7311095,63907470,2016-02-28,4602000,Lisa,We hope to return to this wonderful spot. Really a gem!
7311095,64051187,2016-02-29,31049422,Katie,"My fiance and I loved staying at Jessica and Drew's backyard studio.  It was cozy, tastefully decorated, and very clean.  Also, being less than a block away from the Kennedy School was a definite plus!  There is also a grocery store within walking distance.  Street parking was available right in front of the house.  It was a short drive to the Alberta Arts district, but it wouldn't be a bad walk when the weather is nice. :)  Jessica and Drew were very nice and welcoming, and their dog is sweet, too!  We stayed here during our last night in Oregon, and it had the perfect laid back vibe we needed for our last night of vacation."
7311095,64295297,2016-03-02,4602000,Lisa,This was our second stay and we hope to return in the future. Wonderful place!! We really loved it.
7311095,65348999,2016-03-13,57468663,Jared,"We met Jessica and Drew the day we arrived by chance as we entered their property, and they are very pleasant and their dog is also quite friendly. The listing is true to the pictures. It's charming and was very clean and neat. Our hosts showed us around and explained everything in the space. Staying here helped make our trip that much more enjoyable and memorable."
7311095,65822031,2016-03-17,838606,Samantha,"Jessica and Drew have a wonderful, convenient spot in NE Portland, close to a great supermarket and delicious pizza. The room was quiet and private, with all basic amenities provided. Made for a great place to stay in PDX!"
7311095,66408284,2016-03-22,13889430,Selene,This was a perfect place to explore Portland from. It had everything we needed to feel comfortable and rest well. Jessica & Drew were very friendly and accommodating to our needs. Highly recommended!
7311095,66799540,2016-03-24,2880429,Sarah,"Jessica and Drew were great hosts! I didn't see them during my actual stay, but they were communicative and friendly leading up to the trip. Everything was exactly as advertised and I had a lovely stay. Would definitely recommend their backyard studio to anybody visiting Portland. It's a lovely nook in a great location."
7311095,67544450,2016-03-30,12939517,Esther,"Jessica and Drew were great hosts. The studio was clean, well decorated, and comfortable enough for a long stay. The proximity to Alberta St, Kennedy School, etc was a huge perk. "
7311095,67990537,2016-04-01,1815150,Lynn,"Jessica and Drew have a great and cozy spot in an awesome neighborhood!  They were gracious enough to let us bring both our two pups (who loved running around the fenced in backyard chasing balls and their new friend Bowser).  

Jessica and Drew were so hospitable, and friendly, and gave us great recommendations for a local watering hole and good eats.  There were plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance as well as a great park with an off leash area.

The accommodations were so welcoming with fresh and vibrant decor.  There was coffee provided which we enjoyed very much.  We would absolutely stay here again if we are lucky enough to get another reservation in the future.  It sounds like they stay pretty booked which doesn't surprise me a bit with the great space they have!  Thanks again!"
7311095,68321851,2016-04-04,8111468,Frank,"Jess and Drew were great hosts - very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable, in a great location. Would definitely stay there again.  "
7311095,68884537,2016-04-07,58228192,Meagan,"This was my first airbnb & it was so easy & a great experience. Jessica & Drew messaged me right before I arrived with all the info I needed to get to the location & access the space. It was so nice to not have to worry or think about any of those details. The space was just as it is pictured - super cozy & very sweet. Inside was anything I could have needed over the course of my stay. I met Drew briefly & instantly felt comfortable and welcomed & appreciated that he wanted to make sure I had everything I needed.
The location is great. Seriously. Right next to ... everything. Within walking distance to the Alberta area, but even closer were several coffee shops, restaurants & bars. It was nice to be able to walk everywhere!
I would definitely stay with Jessica & Drew the next time I'm in town for work. If they had availability!
Thank you again!
"
7311095,71431507,2016-04-25,48707375,Alex,"The hideaway was a perfect location, very close to a lot of food and shops on Alberta, but far enough away that it was extremely quiet at night.  "
7311095,72335103,2016-05-02,50234167,Brian,"What an awesome place to stay! The location (literally right next to Kennedy School) was perfect for us! There's also a Walgreens and New Seasons Market close by. Tons of great restaurants/bars on Alberta within easy walking/biking distance! Jessica and Drew were super friendly   And responsive with any questions we had. 

The studio comes equipped with a small kitchenette and a nice spacious bathroom. The bed was also super comfy! I will definitely try and stay here next time I'm in Portland!!"
7311095,73262003,2016-05-07,58448107,Judy,"This was a great location close to shops and restaurants.  It was just as the listing described and Jessica and Drew made us feel welcome, even fresh flowers on the counter when we walked in!

"
7311095,73591366,2016-05-08,18889401,Stephanie,"Jessica and Drew responded quickly to my booking request. My long distance love flew into PDX to visit me from New Jersey and we wanted some place different than my home to stay. It was exciting knowing we'd spend a night at their cozy studio. It was clean, quiet at night, and cool even though it was a hot day! The Kennedy pool is down the street and Jessica provided us some pool towels., and Drew gave us some great recommendations. Our hosts had some friends over and they opened the invite to us if we wanted to join, which was really sweet. My favorite color is orange and so of course, I was quite happy with the decor :). Really nice getaway. I also left my phone charger there and even though I live in Portland, Jessica offered to mail it! "
7311095,74111425,2016-05-13,53463850,Lauren,We had a lovely stay in the Concordia Hideaway. Great location in a quiet neighborhood. We used Jess and Drew's guidebook that lead us to some really great restaurants and bars. Spacious studio with all the amenities needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay. Will definitely check to see if their studio is available when in the area.   
7311095,74406508,2016-05-15,22176451,Andrea,"The unit was private, cozy, and perfect for our stay! It was easy getting in and out of the unit with the key code door and the location was central enough within Portland that getting around by car was quick and convenient. They provided extra amentities like qtips and cottonballs in the bathroom, a french press and hot water pot in the kitchen, and really comfy down pillows that made the stay especially lovely and welcoming! We would absolutely be back. Also - their back yard is gorgeous. If it had been better weather - we would have spent a little more time enjoying the clearly hard work that was put into it! "
7311095,75113085,2016-05-19,51631721,Kasey Jo,"Loved our stay.  Cute, Clean and thoughtfully supplied studio in a great location. Our doggy was welcome, too.  Thank you!"
7311095,75729034,2016-05-22,14240565,Elizabeth,Great place -- very cute and comfortable. It was perfect for a few days of exploring Portland!
7311095,76495251,2016-05-27,34320421,Naomi,"Jessica and Drew were great hosts, very friendly and they have an adorable dog! The place is very clean, has a really cozy yet functional design and everything you could need, (including a French press with coffee)! The location is really prime as well. Don't be daunted by the fact that you'll be staying across the bridge from downtown as 33rd is a popular street and the Alberta arts district has amazing restaurants, bars, a funky Bollywood theater, cute art gallery/ stores, and a lively scene at night. You could easily spend days in this area and not feel bored. Anyways I highly recommend!"
7311095,77669529,2016-06-02,65987618,Mikey,"Welcomed by their lovely dog Bowzer, my partner and I felt at home in the guest house.  Jessica & Drew were very friendly and gave us great ideas for how to spend our time in Portland.  With the Kennedy School two houses down, and a bus stop across the street, this is a great place for couples to get away and explore Portland."
7311095,78118850,2016-06-05,19596289,Sandra,"A lot of attention has been paid into creating this suite to make it a very comfortable and welcoming place to stay.  It's a very peaceful place to stay as well as private....and the neighborhood is fantastic - close to the airport yet within walking to a fantastic grocery store, restaurants & coffee shops.  
We highly recommend this suite as an affordable & fantastic place to stay in Portland."
7311095,78807717,2016-06-09,74658927,Zoila,"Jessica and Drew responded very quickly to my booking request. They were gracious hosts, and the impeccably clean studio was even cuter than the pictures. The neighborhood was great, and the house is a pleasant walk to a huge number of great restaurants and bars. All in all a wonderful first trip to Portland!

"
7311095,79303993,2016-06-12,8121050,Holly,"Jessica and Drew created an absolutely beautiful and relaxing home away from home for their guests! I was so pleased with the home, I was sorry to leave! They keep everything very clean and provide all the little things I need to have a comfortable rest and enjoy my stay.  Easy walking distance to restaurants, grocery shopping, AMAZING coffee and more. Their dog is also a true delight and he made it easier for me to be away from my sweet dog for the week. I would love to have the privilege of staying here again! "
7311095,79899234,2016-06-14,4511050,Shubir,"We had an amazing time at Jess and Drew's place! Clean, great location, and exactly what we needed in a place to stay while checking out Portland for a few days. Would definitely stay here again!"
7311095,80716600,2016-06-19,14325713,Valerie,"The hideaway was very pleasant--simple but nice design and decor. We saw Jessica and Drew a couple times out in the patio area as the weather was fair. They are friendly but give guests space, which we appreciated. Comfortable bed and thoughtful amenities in the bathroom and kitchen to make the stay more comfortable. Would definitely stay again!"
7311095,81723601,2016-06-24,22101723,Rosanne,"This was a great place to stay in Portland! Very close to shops, nightlife and restaurants but not noisy at bedtime. The space was cute,  comfortable, and very clean - it had plenty of room for two and the bed was very comfortable. Good water pressure in the shower too! The studio was well stocked with nice towels, soap/shampoo, dish soap, etc. Our hosts gave us our privacy but let us know they were available if we needed anything. Great stay! "
408577,1140106,2012-04-16,2095104,Kyleen,"Ruby was an amazing host! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The atmosphere was amazing, the garden was so fantastic. We were constantly delighted by the fantastic smell of herbs and flowers. Showering in the outdoor shower was really great.  "
408577,1258419,2012-05-10,2135171,Jennie,"This is a magical backyard paradise in the heart of an interesting neighbourhood full of amazing restaurants.  I don't think I will ever want to have a bath inside after lazing in the outdoor clawfoot bathtub in the lush and private gardens.

The cottage was a lovely space and if you are wondering about the composting toilet, I can tell you I am now a total convert! I would stay here again if I am lucky enough to come back to Portland.

Oh, and it was nice to stay somewhere that was so accommodating to dogs!"
408577,1298773,2012-05-18,2088327,Isa,"we found ruby's space to be incredibly healing and inspiring. from the abundance and beauty of the gardens, the comfort of the sauna, the freshness of the outdoor shower amidst the peacefulness of the buddha to the welcoming, aromatic and calming rooms inside. ruby's creativity and dedication to knowledge and beauty is effortlessly manifested in every object, every corner. it is a sanctuary in an already beautifully conscientious city. ruby was also an amazing host, we felt at home right away, hoping to learn from her extensive herbal, aromatherapy and gardening knowledge which she gracefully offered when asked. we highly recommend this space to anyone wanting a peaceful, beautiful and inspiring stay in portland. "
408577,1331066,2012-05-22,2335311,Rusty,"Great one of a kind place to stay in a great Portland neighborhood.  If you looking for your own personal ashram in middle of Portland, I can't recommend Ruby's place enough.  "
408577,1468479,2012-06-12,2397297,Rachael,"This apartment is quirky, we enjoyed the use of the outside shower and sauna, which was in a great setting with a beautiful garden. One thing that should have been mentioned to us was that Ruby kept Bee's in the garden. Luckily none of us were allergic, but it did worry me that other guests might have been and had no warning. The beds were comfortable and the building itself was homemade and had some beautiful design features. The compost toilet was easy to get used to, however, we only stayed for two nights and it was nearly over flowing, so this should have been emptied before we arrived. The location is good, there is a lot of cafes and bars in the area, and the bus stop into town town is very close. 
However, there were some negative aspects to our stay. When we arrived we had to wait outside the house for Ruby for a while as she had gone out on errands. When she showed us into the house she then had to come in and do some jobs she had missed out such as dusting cobwebs We found this highly un-organised and meant that we couldn't settle down right away after a long drive we were ready to. We were also only given half a toilet roll (which was stuffed with old wrappers in the middle) so we had to go out and buy our own. The most negative aspect of our stay was the day of check out. The information we had been given when booking said our check out time was flexible. I woke at 10.15am on the day of check out, to find I had 8 messages from Ruby. She was asking when we could leave, and saying that we needed to be out by 10.30am as she had somebody arriving at 11am. My friends had gone out for the morning so  I had to pack up all of our stuff immediately to make sure we were out before the other guest arrived. Ruby did not even apologize for this inconvenience, and to make matters worse, I received a text from her 5 minutes after accusing us of 'smoking in her temple'. We had not smoked anywhere on the property,  as we had asked her already what her policy was. 

I would recommend the location of Portland, and even the facilities of the apartment, but I would not like to rent from somebody so unprofessional and lacking in organizational skills again. Rubys' accusations put a negative feel on our visit to Portland."
408577,1506205,2012-06-18,2358481,Simon,"The hospitality and warmth of my stay at this location far exceeded all expectations. From the comfortable bed to the serene outside shower and private mediation area, this space is truly a unique gem; a sacred retreat in the heart of southeast Portland. I highly recommend staying here for those who are looking for a bit of sanctuary in a beautiful quiet but happening neighborhood."
408577,1954536,2012-08-12,2266253,Asha,"Ruby was such a thoughtful and understanding hostess!! I stayed at the cottage for 7 weeks and loved every minute of it. She really went out of her way to ensure that I was well cared for. Knowing I was from out of town and staying awhile she let me know about fun events in the city. The space is absolutely *gorgeous* and an amazing retreat from my usual busy/stressed urban lifestyle. The gardens were relaxing and inspiring, and I will sincerely miss the tranquility of the outdoor shower. She was AMAZING when it came to my dog! My dog is larger and can be a bit of a handful at times, but Ruby voluntarily took her on walks and even to the beach! She was even understanding when my dog scratched at the screen door, and we worked out how to fix it with full communication and support by both parties. This level of compassion hasn't always been the case, I've found, when traveling with a dog, so I especially appreciate it!! Overall I would highly recommend Ruby's oasis in Portland--both the space and the hostess are wonderful to be around. It is an inspiring place to spend a weekend or several weeks!"
408577,1984610,2012-08-14,455254,Elizabeth,"Ruby's cottage is a beautiful little retreat in a lovely part of Portland. Shops and restaurants are within easy walking distance, and there is plenty of street parking if you have a car. The cottage is comfortable and rustic. The bath and shower are out in the garden, and I think my favorite part of our Portland visit was bathing in the clawfoot tub under the grapevines. The garden is a little edible paradise during summer, with berries and herbs growing everywhere. I only wish I had spent more time at the cottage rather than out exploring the city. Maybe during my next visit.

Ruby was a kind host. She had asked that we meet her at a precise time when we arrived, which we did, but she wasn't ready for us. We had to wander the neighborhood for about a half hour while she finished cleaning the cottage. It was in perfect order when we arrived, so I wrote it off as a minor annoyance and decided to just go with the flow since I was on vacation.

This is a beautiful space for those who don't mind living close to nature. I hope to visit again."
408577,2238512,2012-09-09,3030222,Keith,"Ruby is an excellent host and her little ""cottage"" in her back garden is exactly what we were looking for. Short walk to Hawthorne and beautiful surroundings. The outdoor shower was very pleasant and the compost toilet was no worries. You can come and go as you please and fresh fruit hanging from the trees. What more could you want? Thanks Ruby, loved it. "
408577,2397303,2012-09-24,3491987,Susan,What a wonderful escape in the heart of Portland.  The beds were very comfortable and after a long intensive day doing Tai Chi it was a great place to rest and hang out.  We especially enjoyed the outdoor shower amidst the grape arbor filled with yummy grapes.  Ruby was a thoughtful hostess and her gardens delightful.  I would definately stay there again.
408577,42159813,2015-08-11,12757732,James,"A unique Portland experience! Cute little backyard cottage just as described. Ruby was very friendly, we didn't see her a whole lot but she was always available to answer our questions via text. The edible landscaping was an unexpected bonus: grapes, raspberries, goji berries, and more! Comfortable beds, quiet location, everything very tidy. The incinerating toilet takes a little getting used to, but once you get it it is fine. Would definitely stay here again."
408577,42588618,2015-08-14,39837098,Shunqing,It's really a nice place in a beautiful neighborhood. The house is full of surprise which demonstrates a sustainable life style. Ruby arranges everything for us.
408577,43095233,2015-08-17,9318911,Greg,The cottage is amazing! Peaceful and spacious.  Ruby is an amazing host. I stayed in one of her spare bedrooms last year when they were doing work on the cottage.  I fell in love with her home.  I didn't have any problems.  Her place was very tidy and she is quick to respond if I had any questions.  Every time I go back to Portland I will be staying at Ruby's!
408577,44548794,2015-08-27,23950141,Kimmy,"Ruby is super kind, very welcoming and knowledgable on what to do and where to go. The description was accurate, and the neighborhood is very peaceful!  We couldn't have asked for a better environment to come home to after exploring Portland for the first time!  Thanks Ruby, hope to see you again soon!"
408577,45682256,2015-09-05,20024419,Claudia,"Das H√§uschen von Ruby ist wundersch√∂n mit besonderem Charme in einer sch√∂nen,ruhigen Gegend mit guten Parkm√∂glichkeiten. Es gibt eine Au√endusche,die uns gut gefallen hat,aber halb offen ist und daher nicht unbedingt f√ºr jeden etwas. Auch die Verbrennungstoilette war ein Erlebnis,hat aber bei gleichzeitiger Nutzung mehrerer anderer elektrischer Ger√§te das Stromnetz √ºberlastet. Die Kommunikation hat leider stellenweise nicht so gut funktioniert. "
408577,46792580,2015-09-13,21406235,Robyn,"Her house is amazing so beautiful & homely with an amazing garden and awesome out door shower & bath. Situated between two very cool areas of Portland, everything you need is within walking distance. "
408577,46991697,2015-09-14,40078764,Melissa,Great little cottage in a backyard full of vegetation. A cozy little Portland retreat in the city. 
408577,47708576,2015-09-21,11875534,Becca,Really fantastic stay at Ruby's little cottage. We found it very comfortable for our group of 4. Loved the lush gardens and the outdoor shower was heaven! 
408577,47849449,2015-09-21,8637730,Bebe,Very welcoming and thorough in showing us around the place. 
408577,48647764,2015-09-27,2523036,Matt,"We had a lovely time at Ruby's cottage.  We only stayed one night but it was great -- Ruby was easy to communicate with in the days leading up to our stay, and she showed us the place thoroughly but efficiently upon arrival, and the place itself was cozy, quaint, and charming.  It might be a little small for a family of four, such as ours, for a stay of longer than a day or two, but for what we were looking for, for a single night, it was perfect. Great, quiet neighborhood, and such an idiosyncratic charming cottage.  Two thumbs up."
408577,48824407,2015-09-28,11571839,Camerron,A few friends & I stayed in the sweet backyard cottage for a weekend visit to Portland. Ruby was very sweet & around if we needed her. The space was very peaceful & serene. Very comfortable with lots of light. I highly recommend taking advantage of the sauna & cold plunge tub she has set up. Incinerating toilet experience was both fascinating & educational. Om Kitty was also the sweetest kitty cat in the whole wide world
408577,49660787,2015-10-05,42731881,Daniel,Awesome host. Great place. Perfect location. Everything about my stay there was excellent. 
408577,49844907,2015-10-06,45210931,Jamie,We really enjoyed our stay with Ruby. It was a really cute & unique space & a great location on a quiet street. The bed was really comfortable-& I'm very picky about mattresses due to chronic neck & back pain. Ruby was very friendly & accommodating & I'm sure we will stay there again in the future.
408577,50243604,2015-10-10,44702486,Peter,"Our experience at Ruby's house was delightful. She was very accommodating and polite. The location is great, near lots of store fronts and restaurants. Yet tucked away in the nearby neighborhood. Lots of privacy and all in all had a great time. I plan to go back. "
408577,50414822,2015-10-11,46101168,Amanda,"The cottage was wonderful, and our host was really caring and attentive! The garden outside was beautiful, and the cottage was really cozy. My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and we'll definitely be reserving this cottage again sometime. Also worth noting, the location was perfect- close to Hawthorne but also a couple blocks away and nestled into a beautiful southeast neighborhood. We loved it! "
408577,50459204,2015-10-12,1016278,Noelle,"Check in was easy and quick.  Host wasn't around, but roommate was.  Roommate was friendly and informative.  The place was as described.  
"
4867863,26568554,2015-02-15,27234162,Jessica,"My boyfriend and I came down to Portland for a weekend and this was such a great and unique place to stay! It's pretty close to downtown too. Lance was very welcoming, relaxed, and willing to accommodate our schedule. He gave us a tour of the place, recommended some good local spots, and made us coffee in the mornings. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a one-of-a-kind place to stay in Portland! "
4867863,27686403,2015-03-09,976469,Delia,"Lance was kind, accommodating and most importantly responsive. He was always available when I messaged him through Airbnb. He also gave us his phone number to text him in case we needed anything. When we got there, he gave us a tour of the house and welcomed us to wine and water. The house is mid-century modern style and has some pretty cool pieces if you are into interior design. The room itself had the most amazing view, as you can tell from the pictures. However, it was definitely a delightful surprise when I woke up in the morning at 7 am, I saw a breathtaking sunrise. The room is perfect for 2 people. We had our own bathroom and towels were provided. You will need a car if you want to stay here as the house is up some winding roads. For a quaint relaxing weekend, I would recommend the tree house! Plus, how many times will you get to say that you stayed in a tree house in Portland."
4867863,27911469,2015-03-14,21386648,Joel,Amazing house in a unique area of Portland. Lance was a great host and I would recommend his place for a quite getaway. The view is breath taking from the tree house too. 
4867863,27950758,2015-03-15,28289578,Elizabeth,Our stay with Lance was great! The treehouse is an amazing space to see and the view from our room was beautiful. Lance was helpful and super flexible with checking in and out. We'd definitely recommend Lance's space for any Portland visitors looking for a unique place!
4867863,28340764,2015-03-22,23910490,Joseph,"Lance is a great host, successful entrepreneur, cat owner and long-time Portland resident.  Lance knows where to go and what to do.  His home has a breathtaking view that can be enjoyed from the guest bed through an entire wall of windows.  

Thank you Lance for watching ""Jackie Brown"" with me.  Your projector rocks.  "
4867863,28831998,2015-03-30,4304314,Brian,"An amazing house up in the hills with a great view out over Portland. Lance is a great host - very thoughtful and hospitable. You will need a car if planning to stay here, but it is highly recommended."
4867863,29210303,2015-04-05,29192308,Rashmi,The treehouse was beautiful. We enjoyed our stay. Lance did a great job communicating with us and the room was ready by the time we got there even though we arrived much earlier than what we told him. This place should absolutely be on your list of youre planning to stay in portland!!
4867863,29521953,2015-04-08,12509115,Meghan,"Lance was very accommodating and helpful! The house was amazing, and the guest suite had the most incredible view of Portland!"
4867863,29780147,2015-04-12,23168553,Chelsea,"Beautiful location very close to downtown. It was great being 10 minutes from downtown, yet secluded in the tree house high above Portland. Lance is great and very accommodating. I would definitely stay here again!"
4867863,29869195,2015-04-13,12266201,Shi,"It was a nice experience to live in the treehouse ! The view is incredible nice, you can just lie on the bed and see the night view of Portland city. Having a private bathroom and very comfortable bed. About 12 minutes drive to downtown.( need to drive a little bit mountain road). Lance is a helpful host! We enjoy the stay! "
4867863,30036391,2015-04-16,29928194,Travis,"I had a great time staying at Lance's house. He was a great host, and the house is a true marvel of engineering. The view of Portland was spectacular. I really enjoyed watching the aircraft flying into PDX at night. I look forward to a return trip at a future date. Thanks again Lance!"
4867863,30084785,2015-04-17,22479251,Lanh,Lances place was beautiful. The sunrise from the room is breathtaking. He was very accommodating considering we didn't arrive in to Portland until 2 am. 
4867863,30314051,2015-04-20,22730520,William,"I'm not sure which was more iconic, Lance or his house!  They both are unique and one of a kind.  Lance was very welcoming and an awesome host through the entire weekend.  He obviously loves this house and is more than willing to share it's history if you're interested.  We would not hesitate to recommend this stay to anyone desiring something a bit off the beaten path, not to mention a stunning view of the city, both day and night."
4867863,30521675,2015-04-23,4996520,Jerry,"Our two night stay with Lance went well.  Communication with Lance re arrival times etc went smoothly. The ""treehouse"" is as described and provides a magnificent view of Portland and the Columbia and Willamette Rivers.  I wish we would have had more time to talk to Lance about the history and architectural features of the homer.

"
4867863,30565783,2015-04-24,15184411,Jonathan,Very amazing place to experience. Suits my minimalistic lifestyle too. Very quiet place and a great view of the downtown skyline. Lance is a welcoming host and walked us through the history of the pillars of the place and the designs. Really a memorable Airbnb visit.
4867863,30651188,2015-04-25,552874,Jason,Lance was very welcoming and showed us around his unique property. The bed was comfy and the view amazing.
4867863,30799093,2015-04-27,30281477,Rachel,The house was just as beautiful as listed. Lance was very welcoming and more than happy to suggest places to eat or things to do. The view the first night was breath taking- the city lights brightened the sky. The sunrise in the morning was perfect to wake up to. Overall this was one of the coolest places we could have stayed for my first trip to Portland.
4867863,31008346,2015-04-30,8944424,Tony,"Lance was welcoming and very easy to communicate with. The house and your room are even more incredible than the pictures make it seem. There are a collection of helpful PDX magazines for finding food, but you'll probably spend your entire time gazing out at the city or enjoying the sunrise. Thanks for the awesome stay Lance!"
4867863,31220458,2015-05-03,30915866,Cassandra,"We were pretty busy while we were visiting so we didn't see Lance much, but he was a great host! He offered us a beer when we arrived and was very accommodating to the fact that we got in late. The treehouse is beautiful and was just as advertised! I would definitely recommend staying here."
4867863,31384072,2015-05-04,18926923,Travis,"Lance's house is amazingly beautiful. My stay was very comfortable and I enjoyed every second there. Also, the view of the room was breathtaking! I would definitely recommend Lance's House to anyone who is going to Portland."
4867863,31497125,2015-05-05,32289340,Beverly,"All I can say is WOW! The view of Portland was wonderful, the neighborhood intriguing, the house spectacular,  and Lance was a GREAT host. I hope we can make it back again. "
4867863,31592063,2015-05-07,13976460,Philip,"The Iconic Saul Zaik Treehouse was an eye-opening experience. The views were beautiful.  Lance was very accommodating.  If you are interested in unique spaces, this is a secret, quiet location.
"
4867863,31646312,2015-05-08,4362710,Kelly,Lance's home is the single most spectacular view of Portland and the unique architecture should not be missed! Lance was very kind. We had a scheduling glitch that he was able to fix quickly!
4867863,31712911,2015-05-09,4362710,Kelly,Lance's home is the single most spectacular view of Portland and the unique architecture should not be missed! Lance was very kind. We had a scheduling glitch that he was able to fix quickly!
4867863,31781358,2015-05-10,10793999,Shonna,"The ""house on a stick"" is absolutely beautiful... the space has great views and the room is comfy and well kept. We woke up to watch the sunset, experiencing something in Portland you could only see from a few locations. 

Lance was welcoming although some of the pictures in his living room, along with some of his stories made us (three young women) feel a bit uncomfortable. We felt safe since there was a lock on the door. Probably best suited for couples and not single women travelers. "
4867863,32066864,2015-05-13,30917324,Pieter,"The contact and welcome with Lance was great. He answers quickly, and when we arrived at his property we had a good welcoming conversation and on site tour. 
The location is amazing, great property and stunning views. "
4867863,32136996,2015-05-14,11462501,Slade,"Wow! What an incredible space. The home is truly one of a kind with a beautiful location. Lance was very welcoming and friendly, willing to talk but also seemingly happy to give you your space as well. Great host, would definitely recommend. "
4867863,32695155,2015-05-20,31050207,Brittany,"This treehouse was an amazing place to stay! The view going to bed each night and waking up each morning is amazing! Lance was very helpful and accommodating. The location is great! It is easy to get to the bus stop, or trails which will easily take you where you want to go. We ran around the community in the morning and was in awe of the houses in that area. Each of them were just so unique. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Portland. "
4867863,32779622,2015-05-21,30929284,Renee,Lance was waiting in the garden for us when we arrived. He was generous with local area tips and spent time sharing the historic details of his amazing property. The treehouse is an architectural wonder.
4867863,32981736,2015-05-24,8513692,Olga,"Lance and his cat were great hosts! Everything was very nice and clean, and a tree house it's an  amazing place to stay! I would definitely recommend to all my friends to stay with Lance in the future and to have this experience!"
4867863,33372411,2015-05-27,30879541,Thao TT,"Lance is very pleasant. Listing & pictures did not do his home justice. Exceeded our expectations. The view & neighborhood couldn't have been more beautiful. His friendly cat, Barbie, is also a big plus. :) 

It's a phenomenal drive up to the house. Passing amazing homes that we've never seen before. Tricky & winding drive up, drive carefully and you'll be fine. 

15 minutes from downtown. Perfect location. "
4867863,33679591,2015-05-31,31241700,Trisha,Beautiful home in a beautiful neighborhood. Lance was very welcoming.
4867863,33835930,2015-06-01,26489535,Sarah,Lance was very welcoming and his home was a marvel to see in person.  The view from bed is impossible to beat--Mt St Helens off in the distance and Portland like I'd never seen it. Would recommend!
4867863,34136414,2015-06-05,15516206,Nancy,"What a fantastic place!  The view is amazing.  And it's super comfortable.  Our bedroom overlooked the city to the east.  We saw the sun begin to. rise over the mountains at 4:30.  We had left the shades up because we had to get up at 5 am anyway.  

Lance was accommodating and welcoming.  We arrived a little earlier than expected, but he was very flexible, and it all worked out well. 

We enjoyed talking with him and he fixed coffee to help us get going in the morning.  A great host!"
4867863,34642174,2015-06-10,32449143,Jaxi,Lance was very welcoming and the place was nice. The panoramic views were very pretty. The neighborhood was very nice.
4867863,34714124,2015-06-11,11347889,Kim,"My experience at Lance's treehouse was everything that I had hoped for and more! The house was gorgeous and the view was absolutely breathtaking. Lance was a very welcoming host, and gave us plenty of recommendations and tips about Portland. To be honest, I wish Lance's treehouse was available for all of the nights we were in Portland, we were only able to book it for one night but it was so worth it. Staying here and watching the sunrise in the morning was amazing. If you're visiting Portland, YOU NEED TO STAY HERE."
4867863,35054454,2015-06-14,35640279,Doug,"Lance was an awesome host, and the home is just incredible. Every Uber driver that stopped at the house wanted to get out and take pictures.  Lance himself was very hospitable, offering a drink and a chat as soon as I arrived, coordinating coffee for my very early morning (I had to get up around 5 to catch a flight), and offering plenty of tips about places to go and things to do around town that all turned out to be pretty solid.  And for the price, this place was an absolute steal.  I would recommend a stay here to anybody in the Portland area."
4867863,35089864,2015-06-15,31620755,Shane,"We found the tree house charming, a wonderful place to stay. You couldn't beat the view. The sunrise was the perfect way to start our day. Lance is a friendly personality with some good tips for enjoying downtown Portland. Would stay again!"
4867863,35467445,2015-06-19,31722029,Nadine,"My husband and I stayed at Lance's house for two nights as the first stop on our honeymoon. The place was perfect. The views from the bedroom are incredible and our room was clean. 

My husband and I are pretty independent so we didn't use Lance to his full ability as host but he was very friendly and great for offering suggestions on places we should visit. 

We would definitely recommend Lance's place to friends and family. Definitely a great start to our honeymoon! :) "
4867863,35925970,2015-06-23,31870237,Melissa,"The treehouse was wonderful and I still can't get over the views.  Lance was such a welcoming host, full of information and recommendations around the area.  The location was great, being just a short drive anywhere in Portland. We spent a good amount of time just enjoying the view of Portland and the surrounding mountains.  Beautiful room and house!  We really enjoyed our stay."
4867863,36025117,2015-06-24,5549178,Cassie And Gilbert,"Lance was a great host and the experience at the treehouse was like non other in Portland! We had great communication with Lance prior to our arrival and we had no problems checking in. He made us feel welcome right away like we were staying with a friend. We even had a chance to meet Barbie, his sweet 20 year old cat. Of course, the room was as described and the views were better than we expected. We only wish we could have stayed longer!"
4867863,36094823,2015-06-25,7201859,Tiffani,"Lance was such an awesome host! We sadly only had one short nice in his home, but our stay in his home was the highlight of our entire month-long trip across the country. He took the time to show us the ins and out of his home, which truly is an architectural marvel. The views alone are to die for. Thanks again, Lance! We will surely be back!!!"
4867863,36220254,2015-06-26,6231045,Sommer,"Lance's place is definitely awesome!  It's easy enough to get there, but be careful if you're not the best driver because it's on a long winding road.  How else does a house get in a tree?!  Uber was really easy to get, and we only waited 7 mins for a car in the morning, which was nothing. 

Lance is a singular being! Beware sensitive souls, as he has a very dry sense of humor, which my boyfriend and I totally got. But like Bob Newhart before him, he's also very chill. He took the time to actually call me to that came up, and he was open and helpful, which I appreciated very much. And he's also incredibly generous. He's definitely a ""mi casa, su casa"" type person, kindly offering to share what was in his kitchen, which like roommates you actually know, like won't do, lol.  It would've been fun to have hung out and learned more about him, he seems like he has some dope stories. And he helped with my luggage, he's definitely a gentleman. 

My only notes are to read the check-in and check out times. Unfortunately we only had one night to spend, and our plans adjusted, which Lance was open to, but for me personally & financially, being there for only 8 hours, was not smart. Even if we had come at 6pm, I think for the cost & location, because we were traveling with friends, who dropped us off, it would've been better to have booked more days to benefit. Than just the one. Though it was a cool experience. I also think if we had had more time in Portland than two days, maybe the one day wouldn't have felt so critical. And also be courteous enough to let him know if you're going to come in after 12! I am courteous enough, and came in before! But I say this for his sake, but also for yours! 

"
4867863,36376049,2015-06-28,10241280,Katelyn,Lance was a welcoming host and we had a wonderful stay at the treehouse. The views were incredible and unforgettable. Our stay was serene and peaceful. We loved waking up to watching the sun rise each morning. We only stayed for two nights and wish we could have stayed longer. Lance told us about hikes around the neighborhood and we had such a fun time exploring. The neighborhood was beautiful. Our last morning we woke up early for a 10 hour drive home and Lance had coffee waiting for us. All in all we had a wonderful stay and Lance was an excellent host. 
4867863,36527143,2015-06-29,31737253,Roberta,"Lanced welcomed us in and the check-in was very easy whether he would have been there or not. Spectacular views and very, very clean!! Loved the tips on where to hike to watch the sunset. Enjoyed finding out about the history of his home. Fun time!!"

4867863,37374029,2015-07-06,36008776,Derek,"Lance was a great host, everything was clean and well prepared. The tree house is as awesome as you imagine. Cool vibes and great views. Remember to take your shoes off!"
4867863,37537228,2015-07-07,213506,Thorben,"Lance's treehouse is really awesome. Amazing views of Portland. Lance welcomed us with some cold PBRs and we had a great talk. If it wasn't booked for our other nights in town, we would have stayed longer."
4867863,37568164,2015-07-08,33518205,Sue,The tree house was my most anticipated stay on my coast-to-coast journey; and it didn't disappoint.  It was such a fun location and offered the most amazing views of the city day and night.  The space was very clean and comfortable.  Lance is a terrific host.  His humorous personality puts one immediately at ease.  He made several suggestions that enhanced my visit.  My only regret is that I didn't plan to stay longer!  
4867863,38117491,2015-07-13,25751741,Francely,Lance's place was probably the coolest place I have ever stayed in! Absolutely gorgeous view of all of Portland! Beautiful house! Gracious and friendly host! Very nice old cat! 
4867863,38295210,2015-07-14,32793960,James,"Spectacular view and extremely comfortable, relaxing room. Took a hike up to watch the sunset on Lance's suggestion - don't miss it! Terrific experience overall. "
4867863,38392675,2015-07-15,27668550,Maxx,The views say it all.  We were able to wake up in the morning and see an awesome sunrise over the city.  Lance was very helpful and gave a great recommendations on a fantastic restaurant.  
4867863,38552807,2015-07-16,23762866,James,"Lance was very welcoming and check in was a breeze. I can't imagine a place that has better views and if architecture interests you, then this house is a must see."
4867863,39009075,2015-07-20,2761603,Philippe,A startling view over Portland from this most fantastic and very pleasing space between trees and the sky. Meeting Lance and Barbie was a treat too.
4867863,39773781,2015-07-26,35148191,Katherine,"A wonderful stay, breathtaking views of Portland, Lance was an excellent host. Get up early to see the sunrise over Portland!! Simply amazing. "
4867863,40444885,2015-07-31,19811222,Lesli,"Lance was a gracious host all week.  The views from the treehouse were amazing!  Great location close to downtown Portland.  It was definitely a great experience.  Thanks for your hospitality, Lance!"
4867863,40588372,2015-08-01,33001570,Katie,"Lance was friendly, house was clean, great views, interesting history. "
4867863,41085128,2015-08-04,10299189,Susan,"Our experience was pleasant and seamless. Lance was very responsive when we messaged him. I would advise to pay close attention to check in and check out times, I failed to do so and didn't realize how late check in was and how early check out was. Lance was very accommodating and it all worked out. The views were beautiful and as several other reviews stated its not necessarily a ""tree house."" It's worth the stay for the views alone! "
4867863,41236095,2015-08-05,37631332,Edward,"Lance was a gracious host and happily shared his house and it's great history. Amazing space and an unforgettable view (great furniture collection too!).

Definitely a unique perch to stay in while checking out Portland. 5-10 min away from downtown and right next to council crest park."
4867863,41363311,2015-08-07,35333904,Joseph,Lance is a stellar host! I could not have asked for a better inaugural airbnb experience. His property has remarkable views of Portland and we were able to achieve so much respite thanks to the serenity of the treehouse and his kind accommodations. The place is furnished beautifully. Lance is such a fun guy and Barbie is a sweetheart. This was a wonderful experience. 
4867863,42397360,2015-08-13,35241856,Dylan,"We stayed at this amazing home for 6 nights. The view from the upstairs living room when you first walk in is amazing. As is the view from the downstairs bedroom where we stayed. The house is very cool, has an interesting story, and comes complete with it's very own moon door (ref: Game of Thrones). It's fairly centrally located in that it only takes 10-15 minutes to get seemingly anywhere in the city. Yet, your so tucked into the woods that you feel peacefully secluded. 

Lance was very accommodating. I wish I had gotten a chance to sit and talk more and get to know him better."
4867863,42570950,2015-08-14,15505111,Geordie,"What a great experience!!

Lance made us feel instantly welcome - there's an air of casual confidence in him that jives perfectly with his EPIC FREAKING TREEHOUSE!

I mean, anybody who lives in a treehouse has got to be cool, right?

That's definitely the case.  Lance was laid back, but ready with a good story, an honest word or just a conscientious action - it made our stay in Portland an easy and memorable one. 

I also got the impression he genuinely enjoys the Airbnb experience, and seemed generously capable of reciprocating as much or as little interaction as I was able (and/or) willing to put forth.  That, for me, is the definition of a consummate host.  

10/10 would stay again: thanks, Lance!

+also the freakishly cool house and mesmerizing view didn't hurt!  :D"
4867863,43051010,2015-08-17,150150,Jay,Tree house was beautiful and a great place to stay. Lance was very friendly. Chatted with us when we wanted but otherwise laid back and doing his own thing.
4867863,43373120,2015-08-19,24779538,Laura,"Amazing view and beautiful place.  Lance was kind and kept to himself.  Had we been able to stay longer, we would've loved to talk to him and get to know him.  Waking up to the sunrise was perfect.  I would highly recommend staying here over a nice hotel and enjoying the hiking close by."
4867863,43620278,2015-08-21,34787810,Sunny,"My staying at Lance's house is enjoyable. There are few hiking tracks near the tree house (about few minutes walking). Lance is a welcoming host. He recommended few ""to dos"" for me and my friend. The tree house is definitely a place worth to stay in Portland. "
4867863,43930639,2015-08-23,873658,Fernando,"What an awesome space!  Lance was super helpful with check-in and gave a great suggestion for a little hike for my wife and I to share a bottle of wine overlooking Portland.  We had an early flight and he even made us a nice French-press pot before we left, perfect!"
4867863,44387070,2015-08-25,40729285,Benjamin,"Lance was a fun guy who lives in an interesting house. He had lots of tips about the best views and stories about things, he was a great host. The house itself was incredible. The views were amazing and the furnishings really brought the whole interior together."
4867863,44641175,2015-08-28,6989398,Rampal,Amazing views of portland. Stunning nights and breathtaking sunrises to wake you each morning. Lance was laid back and welcoming. This is going to be the first place I check anytime I come to portland.
4867863,45211774,2015-08-31,11161883,Sam,"The treehouse was beautiful, delightful, fun. Lance was very warm and welcoming. We were as pleased as could be."
4867863,45317724,2015-09-01,34291680,Brittany,"We LOVED staying here. The view from the bedroom and the sitting room and the garden and the upper floor.... okay, everywhere you look it's beautiful! We stayed here on the 3rd day of our road trip so we didn't interact with Lance much as we were exhausted from our day in Portland. He was very welcoming. "
4867863,45415556,2015-09-02,41529627,Ben,Good experience.  Exactly as advertised.
4867863,45469569,2015-09-03,4266512,Megan,"This treehouse is one of the most unique airbnb stays that we've had. The view is absolutely incredible. Lance was easy to communicate with, and everything was as described."
4867863,45718053,2015-09-05,15877755,Monica,"The place is every bit as beautiful as it looks. It was spotless, and he was very welcoming, willing to engage as much or as little as we wanted. The place is amazingly situated with the best imaginable view of Portland and a 10-15 minute drive from just about anywhere downtown."
4867863,45840953,2015-09-06,29468683,Paige,"Lance was super easy to communicate with, was really easy going and incredibly friendly! We only got to stay the one night but it was worth it! The views and company were what made our trip so memorable and amazing. The tree house is still close to the city centre that you feel like you're up and out of the way from the night life but can reach down town in less than 15 minutes if you wanted to. Great location, and great experience. And the french press coffee in the morning was delightful! "
4867863,46081376,2015-09-07,1463680,Natalia,"We only had a short time to stay at Lance's house, but it was awesome. The house is beautiful & easy to find. Coordinating with Lance and the meet up was smooth. We will definitely be back! 

And oh, the VIEW IS AMAZING!"
4867863,46220587,2015-09-08,34640648,Trent,"Waking up to that view is something you'll never forget. Definitely worth a visit. Lance is a great host, very accommodating and friendly. Great trip! "
4867863,46271423,2015-09-09,11928179,James,Lance made us feel very welcome and was great to meet. The place was really unique and well worth a visit! The views from the bedroom are simply stunning and it was a lovely way to end our time in Portland!
4867863,46716113,2015-09-13,2488771,Noah,"Lance was a great host and very accommodating. He was cool enough to show me the ins and outs of this unique and cool house and tell me the story of its creation. The place itself boasts an unbeatable mountaintop view of Portland and the surrounding landscape, in a serene forested setting. The bedding was comfortable, and I had everything I needed. I will most definitely try to stay here again next time I'm in town."
4867863,47284396,2015-09-17,42317987,Kristie,"One of the most unique homes I've ever been in, the architecture is mind boggling. Lance, our host was generous and interesting to hang out with!  We shared a bottle of wine while enjoying the phenomenal night view of Portland. We slept with the door open breathing in the fresh night air, waking up to a spectacular bird's eye view of the city-WOW!  We snuggled up last night on down pillows in total peace!  This morning it's foggy and rainy but from this vantage point it feels like we are atop a rain forest. You MUST stay here!"
4867863,47640686,2015-09-21,36277892,Lindsey,"Lance was super casual and welcoming. He made us a pot of coffee our first morning there and was flexible with anything we needed. The view is AMAZING. We unfortunately got sick during our stay which kept us resting for a lot of our trip, but with the view it was not a bad thing at all. The house overall is beautiful and peaceful. "
4867863,48075818,2015-09-23,26024361,Victor,"One of the highlights to our trip to Portland was this Saul Zeik treehouse. Lance was very welcoming, down to earth, and generous. We loved hearing the history of the house and hanging out with lance. Definitely a place to stay at while you're in Portland! "
4867863,48294367,2015-09-25,8131128,Seulah Christina,Great and unique house with a magnificient view. Clean and spacious room. Lance was easy to talk to.
4867863,48739747,2015-09-28,42418420,Sean,"The Tree House exceeded expectations:  Lance, our host, extended his wit, implacable taste and a telescope for us to view the Blood Moon eclipse.  "
4867863,49258294,2015-10-02,6834716,Lisa,"This experience was positive in every way.  Communications were clear and arrangements were accomodating to our needs.  I enjoyed the view and was given every opportunity to use the space for yoga, writing and a comfortable sleep.  It's clean, bright and located with the best of Portland outdoors in mind!  Thanks Lance"
4867863,49620613,2015-10-05,37929227,Kyle,"Lances home was exquisite, beautiful, and relaxing.  The view from your room was once and a lifetime view. Definitely worth the experience. Upon meeting Lance he was very friendly, kind, and helpful if needed. Couldn't ask for more. Thank you again Lance!"
4867863,49972972,2015-10-08,36337728,Carol,"What an amazing place to end our week in Oregon! Fantastic house. Fantastic view.Charming host.
 Great bed and a view from it as well. Comfy bedding and luscious towels. Very easy access to downtown and restaurants. Best of both worlds. Close to action or far from it. Highly recommend this experience."
4867863,50187177,2015-10-10,956543,Jacquelyn,A quick but beautiful stay! Lance responds to messages fast and his house is very nice. We parked across the street (at first we were going to Uber or Lyft it over but rented a car and glad we did for the freedom of being able to get out of the city for excursions.)
4867863,50356877,2015-10-11,7336856,Dustin,I loved staying here. My lady friend and I had a wonderful night sleep over looking the city. Even though we had to leave really early the next day we woke up to a great foggy view of the city. I will be back for sure.
4867863,50771864,2015-10-14,43186573,Randol,"Lance arrived at the door of his house just as we drove up -- and even carried my large bag to the bottom floor of the treehouse.  He showed us around the house and even recommended a restaurant downtown ... St. Jack, which was excellent.  This is a magnificent place to survey all of Portland, essentially from the air, and the views from the bedroom and the meditation area (or, at least, that's what we used it for) are unparalleled.  The drive up to the property is an experience as well -- something like 54 switchbacks, winding through some of the most beautiful parts of the area.

If the place is available the next time I'm in Portland, you can bet this is where I'll call home base.  Thanks, Lance -- it was great fun."
4867863,50942824,2015-10-16,32595795,Jerry,Fantastic place and beautiful views!! This is a lifetime experience one should have in this astonishing and unique house!
4867863,51038533,2015-10-17,32595795,Jerry,"Fantastic views, neighborhood and host!  A MUST DO stay!!"
4867863,51313612,2015-10-19,32595795,Jerry,"Absolutely fantastic stay in in this tree house in the clouds!  The neighborhood is also a wonder to behold!! Host was entertaining, witty, kind and very helpful for activities in Portland."
4867863,51447702,2015-10-20,41853950,Benjamin,"Lance was an amazing host. His place is absolutely beautiful. Waking up to a view of the entire city of Portland is indescribable. Lance helped us carry in luggage, had coffee ready for us in the morning, and made us feel at home. We couldn't have picked a better place for the first night of our honeymoon."
4867863,51749891,2015-10-24,2241353,Lesley,"Lance was wonderful and so was the place!  On our first night, we decided to walk to Lance's place from downtown.  It was a good walk, and got the heart-rate up, but was so worth it.  Lance showed us around and then suggested a great Mexican place for dinner and took us there!  Lance made me coffee every morning and was a pleasure to talk to.  Lance's place gave us a great view of the city and was a great area to run.  We decided to take Uber from his place to where we wanted to go, but it was easy enough to go to OHSU and catch the air-tram to down-town.  Highly recommend staying here if you want to be close to downtown but not in downtown.  And Lance is great to talk to, laugh with and he also gives you your privacy.  Thanks so much Lance!!"
4867863,52083505,2015-10-26,30645887,Ashton,"This place is gorgeous! The view does not disappoint. The drive to the house is curvy and full of luscious trees. It's close to parks, hiking trails, and downtown Portland. Lance greeted us upon our arrival and was helpful with unloading our luggage. Our party ended up being larger than anticipated, so we relocated to another place. This is a great spot for a couple's get away or two friends sharing the view of the world together!"
4867863,52536387,2015-10-30,47031410,Bethany,"It's been a few days since our stay at Lance's treehouse, and I am still dreaming of that AMAZING view! I seriously think this must be the best view in Portland! The treehouse was everything it was described to be, and more. Lance was a great host, and made us feel extremely welcome. He made us a delicious French press every morning, and texted us when it was ready! He gave us recommendations for things to do/places to eat around town, and was just a really cool guy in general. I told him to never stop Airbnb-ing it because we DEFINITELY want to come back! We will never travel to Portland without staying here! "
4867863,52655762,2015-10-31,47031410,Bethany,"This is my second review, because after renting the treehouse for two nights I quickly decided to add another night! (I would have added two more nights but the treehouse was already booked the 4th night we were in Portland and we had to stay somewhere WAY less cool, womp womp!) We can't wait to come back to this wonderful treehouse! Seriously, do not stay in a lame hotel! Stay at Lance's place, you will NOT regret it! "
4867863,53022864,2015-11-03,47562932,Shelby,"My first visit to Portland was made unforgettable with a two-night stay at Lance's Saul Zaik Treehouse. Waking up to that amazing view is a humbling beauty everyone must experience. It's true, you WILL have withdraws.
Lance is a wonderful host and efficient with communication. He was flexible when I inquired an earlier check-in and texted me his address for further confirmation. The drive to the treehouse is smooth with beautiful views! There is easy parking located across the street from the treehouse.
Lance greeted us at the door and kindly helped us with our bags down to our room. The guest room and downstairs loft area is simply perfect with the right amount of privacy.  He politely let us get settled and later suggested some good restaurants when we were ready to go out. Lance was genuine to make us feel at home. He made french press in the morning and texted when it was ready. 
I truly felt at home with my first airbnb thanks to Lance. I would definitely stay again.
"
4867863,53344768,2015-11-08,2683748,Steve,"I only wish we could stay longer!  The house is amazing and is everything you'd hope for when booking a treehouse in the portland hills overlooking the city!  Lance is great too, super nice and welcoming.  Made coffee for us in the mornings and really welcomed us into his home to make us feel comfortable.   I would (and plan to) stay here again in the future, this was just GREAT!!!"
4867863,54303950,2015-11-17,10646400,Nelli,Lance was a great host. The house had stunning views even with the gloomy weather during our stay. Lance gave us great restaurant recommendations and made us coffee in the morning. If you're in the Portland area and are looking for a cool place to stay this tree house is for you. It has everything you need and it overlooks the city which is only a few miles away. 
4867863,54327959,2015-11-18,3463868,Carole,"Couldn't have picked a better place to stay! Got in late but was greeted warmly by Lance, and I totally enjoyed watching the city lights below and chatting over a glass of wine. Room was super clean and comfortable, and waking up to the amazing view was magical.  Fresh French- pressed morning coffee was perfect! Plenty of privacy, too. Don't  miss the opportunity to stay with Lance in this architectural wonder!"
4867863,54908779,2015-11-25,2765343,Brian,Lance was extremely welcoming and his place is incredible. While I stayed in the downstairs floor (has own living room and bathroom) he was kind enough to let me use the top floor for a few hours where I proposed to my girlfriend. It's a beautiful apartment with a stunning view.  
4867863,55121217,2015-11-28,20080977,John,"The place was a gem. It is located on the hills above the city, and you get an unobstructed view all the way to my. Helena and Hood. To be clear to those who rent, the rental is for the entire downstairs area and Lance lives on the second level. Lance was great about communicating and gave us our space to enjoy our stay. He also made coffee for us in the morning and made us feel very welcome! Would definitely recommend."
4867863,55306536,2015-11-29,36731331,Nick,Lance was an awesome host with a beautiful home. The view of the sunrise was amazing and the room was very cozy. Perfect distance from downtown not too far but not too close. Would definitely recommend staying here for an unforgettable time in Portland. And oh yea the coffee in the morning was a nice touch! 
4867863,55787913,2015-12-06,9537689,Libby,"We enjoyed our stay in Lance's unique home, especially the spectacular views. Lance welcomed us warmly and gave us a tour, explaining the history of his home. It served as a great base for exploring Portland. "
4867863,56150065,2015-12-09,32835417,Savannah,"Ok so lance is a totally awesome down to earth guy. His place is made of an old world war 2 mast with a delicious view of Portland. Bukowski, his precious cat made us feel even more welcome. He wouldn't recite any poems but he did stay off the counters. Nice way to see us off with a hot cup of coffee."
4867863,56357106,2015-12-12,13405956,Angela,"Lance and Bukowski were great hosts and so flexible with our coming in late.  I can't say enough about the amazing view, and  great conversation over wine.  We had a great time and would definitely stay again!"
