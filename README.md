# BigML.io Java bindings

In this repository you'll find an open source Java client that gives
you a simple binding to interact with [BigML](https://bigml.io). You
can use it to easily create, retrieve, list, update, and delete BigML
resources.

## Integrating Maven

Add the following dependency to your project's pom.xml file:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.bigml</groupId>
        <artifactId>bigml-binding</artifactId>
        <version>1.5</version>
    </dependency>

Add the following lines to your project's pom.xml file if you want to use the SNAPSHOT versions of the library:

    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>osshr-snapshots</id>
            <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
            <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
            <releases><enabled>false</enabled></releases>
        </repository>
    </repositories>

## Requirements

You will find in the `binding.properties` file where to setup your BigML credentials
`BIGML_USERNAME` and `BIGML_API_KEY`, and the `BIGML_SEED` to be used by BigML to make deterministic samples and models.
They can be overwritten passing the values as JVM variables with `-D`.

The project uses Maven as project manager.

## Running the Tests

There is a test suite using [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) available,
you may want to run it by execute:

```bash
$ mvn test
```

or this way, if you want to debug the tests

```bash
$ mvn -Dmaven.surefire.debug="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000 -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE" test
```

## Generated JAR file of the bindings

Since version 1.1 the name of the JAR file is _bigml-binding_.
